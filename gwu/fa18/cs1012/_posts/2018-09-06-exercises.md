# Exercises
Each exercise describes exactly what you must submit.  **DO NOT** submit individual files.  Save everything described into one folder, zip that folder, and submit the zip containing all files.

## Exercise 1 - Hello World!
Write a "Hello World" script using IDLE.  Save this script as ```hello.py```.  Run the script.  Take a screenshot of the output from ```hello.py``` in IDLE shell and save the screenshot as ```hello.png```.  Submit both ```hello.py``` and ```hello.png```.

## Exercise 2 - Turtle with Variables
Write a script that implements the circumscribed diamond from the introductory [Exercise 2]({{ "/gwu/fa18/cs1012/2018/08/28/exercises.html" | absolute_url }}) again using the variable ```r``` for the radius of the circle.  Use the ```sqrt``` function to compute the length of a side of the diamond based on the value assigned to ```r```.  Save the script as ```cdiamond.py``` and run the script.  Save a screen shot of the diamond as ```cdiamond.png```.  Submit both ```cdiamond.py``` and ```cdiamond.png```.
