## Lab 4

### Instructions

You are allowed to collaborate with your neighbor on these exercises.  Each of you must complete the programming tasks individually; however, you are encouraged to discuss and work together to design a solution to the problems.   It's a good idea to have pen and paper available.

Before beginning, make sure to create a new folder named ```lab04``` in your class folder.

### Exercise 1 - Month of the year

Write a program that iterates using a ```for``` loop which prints the number indicating the month of the year and the corresponding name of the month.

Create a list composed of the strings ```"January"```, ```"February"```, ```"March"```, ```"April"```, ```"May"```, ```"June"```, ```"July"```, ```"August"```, ```"September"```, ```"October"```, ```"November"```, and ```"December",```.  Each iteration through the loop, print out a number indicating the numeric month of the year and the name of the month.  For example, your program should produce the following output:

```
Month 1 of the year is January
Month 2 of the year is February
Month 3 of the year is March
Month 4 of the year is April
Month 5 of the year is May
Month 6 of the year is June
Month 7 of the year is July
Month 8 of the year is August
Month 9 of the year is September
Month 10 of the year is October
Month 11 of the year is November
Month 12 of the year is December
```

> Hint: there is only one loop variable.  We have not discussed much about lists, but we have seen that we can iterate over list and assign each element to the loop variable.  The question you might be asking is "How do you count though if you iterate over the list".  A simple answer is to use an accumulator that increments by one each iteration to count each pass through the loop.

### Exercises 2 & 3 - Square Pattern

For these two exercises, we will write a program that draws square patterns.  We will tackle one part of the problem in the Exercise 2 and then expand on that solution in Exercise 3.  Make sure to save each in a separate file, _i.e._ once you finish exercise 2, save it in a file and then copy that code into another file for exercise 3.

### Exercise 2 - Draw a Row of Squares

For exercise 2, you will draw the following pattern:

![Array]({{ "/gwu/sp20/cs1012/assets/lab4/array.png" | absolute_url }})

This pattern primarily consists of a set of squares but you can see that each square is adjacent to another square.  Let's break this problem down into smaller pieces.  Drawing the pattern involves drawing a square and then repositioning the turtle in order to draw the next square.  This process is repeated a total of 4 times.

You must use the variables ```length``` and ```columns```.  ```length``` should be assigned a value of ```50``` and is used in all calculations that depend on the length of the side of a square.  ```columns``` should be assigned a value of ```4``` in this example and is used in all calculations that depend on the number of squares to draw.  

We have already discussed how to draw a square using a loop, so your program must use a loop to draw the squares.  Additionally, you will need another loop that controls how many squares to draw which is dependent on ```columns``` and encapsulates both the square drawing and the repositioning operations.

Drawing the pattern will require two loops, one nested inside the other.  The outer-loop repositions the turtle and ready it to draw a square.  

### Exercise 3 - Draw a Grid

For exercise 3, you will draw the following pattern:

![Array]({{ "/gwu/sp20/cs1012/assets/lab4/grid.png" | absolute_url }})

The exercise extends the work that you have done in exercise 2.  In exercise 2 you have already tackled drawing a row of squares in the grid.  For this exercise, you will extend this work to draw multiple rows.  This will require adding another loop around the already existing nested loops from exercise 2.  Before continuing, make sure that you have fully completed exercise 2, create a new document for this exercise, and copy your code from exercise 2 into the document for exercise 3.

In exercise 2 we broke down drawing a single row into its constituent operations, so now we must focus on breaking down the new steps to draw multiple rows.  The process is decomposed into:

1. Draw a row
2. Reposition for next row
3. Repeat until all rows are drawn

We have already solved step 1 and this code will not need to change; however, we will need to address the other steps.

For a set of squares, it is trivial to reposition for the next row.  We can compute the length of the row by computing the product of the ```length``` of a square and the number of ```columns```.  This product instructs us how far to the left of the screen we need to move the turtle.  We also need to advance to the next row which is simply the ```length``` of a square.  This process needs to be performed each time that we have drawn a row.

Repeating until all rows are drawn is also trivial if we use a ```for``` loop.  Add another variable named ```rows``` and assign it a value of ```5```.  Use the rows variable to control the the ```for``` loop for step 3.  You must also use rows in any computations that you perform that are dependent on the number of rows.

Focus first on drawing the pattern and ignore the location of the pattern within the drawing area.  Once you are drawing the pattern, focus on repositioning the pattern such that it is centered.  This code too must be generalized and use expressions that involve ```length```, ```rows```, and ```columns``` to set the initial position before drawing the grid.
