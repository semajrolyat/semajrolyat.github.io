## Lab 4

### Due Date
**The solutions to these exercises must be submitted by the end of the day.**

### Instructions

Before trying to write any code, plan out how you will to use the primitives defined here to draw the solution.  If you don't plan, you may make a mistake and have to start over.  It's a good idea to have pen and paper available.

You are allowed to collaborate with your neighbor on these exercises.  Each of you must complete the programming tasks individually; however, you are encouraged to discuss and work together to design a solution to the problems.

Before beginning, make sure to create a new folder named ```lab04``` in your class folder.

Create a .zip archive containing all of your code files and submit the .zip archive to blackboard as your solutions to these exercises.

### Exercise 1 - Month of the year
> This exercise will allow you to work with input, strings, and formatted output.

Write a program that iterates using a ```for``` loop which prints the number indicating the month of the year and the corresponding name of the month.

Create a list composed of the strings ```"January"```, ```"February"```, ```"March"```, ```"April"```, ```"May"```, ```"June"```, ```"July"```, ```"August"```, ```"September"```, ```"October"```, ```"November"```, and ```"December",```.  Each iteration through the loop, print out a number indicating the numeric month of the year and the name of the month.  For example, your program should produce the following output:

```
Month 1 of the year is January
Month 2 of the year is February
Month 3 of the year is March
Month 4 of the year is April
Month 5 of the year is May
Month 6 of the year is June
Month 7 of the year is July
Month 8 of the year is August
Month 9 of the year is September
Month 10 of the year is October
Month 11 of the year is November
Month 12 of the year is December
```


#### Exercise 2 - Sum All Positive, Even Integers from 100 to 200    -> [100, 200)

Write a script that computes the sum of all positive even integers from 100 to but **not including** 200 and prints the total sum after the computation finishes.  You must use a ```for``` loop with the ```range``` function to perform this computation.  

Your program should produce the following output:
```
7450
```

### Exercise 3 - Square ladder
Write a script that draws this pattern:

![Square Ladder]({{ "/gwu/sp20/cs1012/assets/lab4/squares.png" | absolute_url }})


**Requirements:**
  - you **must** use a for loop to draw a square
  - you **must** use a for loop to repeat the above pattern

> **Hint:**  you can use a **nested loop** to achieve the above pattern
