## Lab 3 - Variables, Expressions, and Types

### Preface

Before trying to write any code, plan out how you will to use the primitives defined here to draw the solution.  If you don't plan, you may make a mistake and have to start over.  It's a good idea to have pen and paper available.

You are allowed to collaborate with your neighbor on these exercises.  Each of you must complete the programming tasks individually; however, you are encouraged to discuss and work together to design a solution to the problems.

### Introduction

Unlike the simplicity of the Turtle exercises we've done thus far, computers are capable of much
more useful functionality.
Today, we will introduce complexity by working with variables, expressions, and types.

In order to investigate some of these new topics, we will first introduce simple output at the terminal and we will learn how to gain access to the ```math``` library so that we can use complex mathematical operations.      

### Output to a Terminal Window / Printing
We can output information into the terminal by using the ```print``` command.  ```print``` will write to the terminal any string information that appears inside the parentheses.  Multiple strings can be printed to the terminal (separated by a space) if each string is separated by a comma.  

For example, run the following code:
```python
print("Hello World")
```
You will see the follow output in the terminal:
```
Hello World
```

Also run the following code:
```python
print("Hello", "World")
```
You will see the follow output in the terminal:
```
Hello World
```

Note that the above print statements produce equivalent output in the terminal even though we printed one string in the first example and two separate strings in the second example.

We can also output the values stored in a variable using the ```print``` command.  For example, the following code prints the value of the variable ```x```:

```python
x = 100
print(x)
```

We can also combine a string with a variable using the earlier comma separation technique to create a more meaningful output:

```python
x = 100
print('x =', x)
```

The above example prints the following output to the terminal:
```
x = 100
```

### Computing a Square Root
To calculate square roots, the most practical solution is by using the **sqrt** function from the
**math** module. The Math module offers many higher-level mathematical functions, but is ***not***
required for basic operations.

**Import statement:**

```python
import math
```


You will then have a function named ```math.sqrt``` available in your program that you can use to compute a square root.  For example:
```python
import math          # import the math module to access the sqrt function

x2 = 9
x = math.sqrt(x2)    # compute the square root of x2 and store in x     
print(x)
```
The above program produces the following output:
```
3.0
```

You will need to use the square root function in today's exercises.


### Taking Input From the Console

The ```input(prompt)``` function allows a Python programmer to request input from a user at the command line.  The ```prompt``` parameter inside the parentheses for ```input(prompt)``` represents the message as a ```string``` that the programmer wishes to print in order to prompt the user for input.  For example, the following Python code prints "Enter a value: " to the terminal, waits for the user to enter information, and then assigns ```x``` when the user presses the *RETURN* or *ENTER* key on the keyboard:

```python
x = input("Enter a value: ")
```

In the above code, whatever information that was entered by the user before pressing the *ENTER* key is stored in the variable ```x```.

In order to use information input by the user, we must make sure that it is of the correct type.  The first question we must ask is what the inherent type of the information that was input.  The following code will make clear the inherent type of user input:

```python
x = input("Enter a value: ")
print(type(x))
```
If we run the above code several times and enter the following inputs:
```
1
1.0
abc
```
We will see that regardless of what values a user enters, the type is always reported as ```str``` or a string type.  If a programmer wishes to use a value entered by the user as a specific type, the programmer must cast the data returned from input as the desired type.


## Exercises

### Exercise 1 - Introduction
> This exercise uses input, strings, and formatted output.

Create a script named ```exercise1.py```.

Write a program that prompts the user to input their name.  The prompt should read ```What is your name?```.

Store the user's response in a variable.  Build a string that combines ```Hello ``` with the user input, and ```. I am Python.```.  Finally, print the entire string to the console.

**IMPORTANT:** Your output **must** be in this format:
```
What is your name? <user input>
Hello <stored user input>.  I am Python.
```

Run your program and make sure that your program produces the expected output.  For example, if ```John``` is entered in response to the prompt, interaction with the program would look like the following:
```
What is your name? John
Hello John.  I am Python.
```

### Exercise 2 - Quadratic Formula
> This exercise will allow you to work with expressions, variables, the mathematical function ```sqrt```, operator precedence, types and input.

Recall that a Quadratic Equation has the form:

![Quadratic Equation]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/lab03/quadratic-eq.png" | absolute_url }})

The Quadratic Formula allows us to compute the roots of a Quadratic Equation and is defined by the formula:

![Quadratic Formula]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/lab03/quadratic-formula.png" | absolute_url }})

We cannot successfully compute roots for all Quadratic Equations because some of the roots will be imaginary.  We will only test our scripts using a narrow set of coefficients that we can compute so that we do not generate any errors.  Test your scripts with the inputs of ```a```, ```b```, and ```c``` illustrated below and make sure that your program prints the same output to the terminal.  

Like the previous exercise, assign ```a```, ```b```, and ```c``` to the values indicated below, run the program, and compare the results to the output listed below.  If your results differ from the results below, there is an error in your program, so you must correct the error and start over with the first test.  If your test produces the correct results, use the next test and repeat the process until you can successfully demonstrate that your program produces the correct answers for all three tests.

Create a script named ```exercise2.py```.

Write a script that takes user inputs using the ```input``` function for ```a```, ```b```, and ```c``` for the Quadratic Equation.  Compute the two roots of the Quadratic using the Quadratic Formula, and print the roots to the console.

The structure of your output should look similar to:
```
Input the coefficients for Quadratic Equation f(x):
a = <coefficient 1>
b = <coefficient 2>
c = <coefficient 3>

The Quadratic Equation has the following roots:
root = <calculated root 1>
root = <calculated root 2>
```

Because we cannot successfully compute roots for all Quadratics, we will only test our scripts using a narrow set of coefficients that we can compute so that we do not generate any errors.  You must take user input using the ```input``` function.  Format your output and test your script with the following examples:

```
Input the coefficients for Quadratic Equation f(x):
a = 1
b = 0
c = -1

The Quadratic Equation has the following roots:
root = 1
root = -1
```

```
Input the coefficients for Quadratic Equation f(x):
a = 4
b = -3
c = -2

The Quadratic Equation has the following roots:
root = 1.175390529679106
root = -0.42539052967910607
```

```
Input the coefficients for Quadratic Equation f(x):
a = 2
b = -1
c = -2

The Quadratic Equation has the following roots:
root = 1.2807764064044151
root = -0.7807764064044151
```

#### Exercise 3 - Temperature Conversions

> This exercise uses: **input**, **strings**, and **types**.

Create a script named ```exercise3.py```.

The United States commonly uses the **Fahrenheit** scale. For scientific calculations, **Celsius** is used.
The formula to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius is:

```
C = (F - 32) * 5/9
```

Write a program that takes a **Fahrenheit** temperature as input and prints out the temperature converted to **Celsius**.  

Your program must use the following format for the prompts and output:
```
Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: <input temp>
<input temp> degrees Fahrenheit is <computed temp> degrees Celsius.
```

Test your script with **all** of these examples:
```
Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: 32
32.0 degrees Fahrenheit is 0.0 degrees Celsius.
```

```
Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: 212
212.0 degrees Fahrenheit is 100.0 degrees Celsius.
```

```
Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: 72
72.0 degrees Fahrenheit is 22.22222222222222 degrees Celsius.
```

```
Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: -40
-40.0 degrees Fahrenheit is -40.0 degrees Celsius.
```

> Note that the string representations of the numbers suggest the data types used in the calculation.
