## Lab 3 - Variables, Expressions, and Types

### Instructions

Before trying to write any code, plan out how you will to use the primitives defined here to draw the solution.  If you don't plan, you may make a mistake and have to start over.  It's a good idea to have pen and paper available.

You are allowed to collaborate with your neighbor on these exercises.  Each of you must complete the programming tasks individually; however, you are encouraged to discuss and work together to design a solution to the problems.

Before beginning, make sure to create a new folder named ```lab03``` in your class folder.

### Introduction

So far, our interactions with Python have been primarily limited to writing programs that instruct the ```turtle``` to move in various ways.  Movement of the ```turtle``` generates output in the form of an image in a window.  Naturally, we have primarily focused on combining simple statements together to draw geometric shapes.  With the broad number of applications available today, computers are clearly capable of deeper interactions supported by more sophisticated calculation.

Today, we will take another step forward by working with variables, expressions, and types.  We will understand the usefulness of some of the more esoteric operators such as integer division and modulus, we will revisit a previous lab exercise and improve it a bit by adding variables, and we will examine why it is important for a programmer to fully express intent through explicit precedence when performing complex calculations.

In order to investigate some of these new topics, we will first introduce simple output at the terminal and we will learn how to gain access to the ```math``` library so that we can use complex mathematical operations.      

### Output to a Terminal Window
We can output information into the terminal by using the ```print``` command.  ```print``` will write to the terminal any string information that appears inside the parentheses.  Multiple strings can be printed to the terminal (separated by a space) if each string is separated by a comma.  

For example, run the following code:
```python
print("Hello World")
```
You will see the follow output in the terminal:
```
Hello World
```

Also run the following code:
```python
print("Hello", "World")
```
You will see the follow output in the terminal:
```
Hello World
```

Note that the above print statements produce equivalent output in the terminal even though we printed one string in the first example and two separate strings in the second example.

We can also output the values stored in a variable using the ```print``` command.  For example, the following code prints the value of the variable ```x```:

```python
x = 100
print(x)
```

We can also combine a string with a variable using the earlier comma separation technique to create a more meaningful output:

```python
x = 100
print('x =', x)
```

The above example prints the following output to the terminal:
```
x = 100
```

We will discuss more about strings in future classes; however, this is a simple primer for using strings and printing to the terminal that you may find very useful for checking the value of a variable at a specific point in your program.  You can insert print statements at any point in the program and print the value of a variable at that point.  You can then compare the output between two or more points in a program to see whether the variable has the value that you expect it does.  This is one way to "debug" a program.

### Computing a Square Root
In previous exercises, we needed to compute a square root to be able to use the Pythagorean theorem.  In order to do so, we precomputed the square root by hand and then hardcoded that value into the program as a literal.  This is not always feasible; because we do not necessarily know the value in advance of running a program that requires a square root computation.

Of course Python has built in operations to compute mathematical operations such as square root.  These operations or "functions" are built into the ```math``` module.  We will talk more about the available Python mathematics functions and modules later; however, you may find it useful to use the square root operation sooner than later.

In order to gain access to the square root function, we will need to "import" the mathematics module into our program.  To do so, add the following statement at the beginning of any program where you need to use square root:
```python
import math
```

> Note that whenever we use the turtle, we use a statement that includes ```import turtle```.  When we import ```turtle```, we gain access to the turtle commands.  Likewise, when we import ```math```, we gain access to a variety of complex mathematics operations like square root, trigonometric functions, and logarithmic functions.  We _**DO NOT**_ need to import ```math``` in order to access the basic arithmetic operators like addition, multiplication, or integer division.

You will then have a function named ```math.sqrt``` available in your program that you can use to compute a square root.  For example:
```python
import math          # import the math module to access the sqrt function

x2 = 9
x = math.sqrt(x2)    # compute the square root of x2 and store in x     
print(x)
```
The above program produces the following output:
```
3.0
```

You will need to use the square root function in today's exercises.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1 - Introduction
> This exercise uses input, strings, and formatted output.

Create a script named ```exercise1.py```.

Write a program that prompts the user to input their name.  The prompt should read ```What is your name?```.

Store the user's response in a variable.  Build a string that concatenates ```Hello ``` with the user input, and ```. I am Python.```.  Finally, print the entire string to the console.

**IMPORTANT:** Your output **must** be in this format:
```
What is your name? <user input>
Hello <concatenated user input>.  I am Python.
```

Run your program and make sure that your program produces the expected output.  For example, if ```John``` is entered in response to the prompt, interaction with the program would look like the following:
```
What is your name? John
Hello John.  I am Python.
```

### Exercise 2 - Quadratic Formula
> This exercise will allow you to work with expressions, variables, the mathematical function ```sqrt```, operator precedence, types and input.

Recall that a Quadratic Equation has the form:

![Quadratic Equation]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/lab03/quadratic-eq.png" | absolute_url }})

The Quadratic Formula allows us to compute the roots of a Quadratic Equation and is defined by the formula:

![Quadratic Formula]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/lab03/quadratic-formula.png" | absolute_url }})

We cannot successfully compute roots for all Quadratic Equations because some of the roots will be imaginary.  We will only test our scripts using a narrow set of coefficients that we can compute so that we do not generate any errors.  Test your scripts with the inputs of ```a```, ```b```, and ```c``` illustrated below and make sure that your program prints the same output to the terminal.  

Like the previous exercise, assign ```a```, ```b```, and ```c``` to the values indicated below, run the program, and compare the results to the output listed below.  If your results differ from the results below, there is an error in your program, so you must correct the error and start over with the first test.  If your test produces the correct results, use the next test and repeat the process until you can successfully demonstrate that your program produces the correct answers for all three tests.

Create a script named ```exercise2.py```.

Write a script that takes user inputs using the ```input``` function for ```a```, ```b```, and ```c``` for the Quadratic Equation.  Compute the two roots of the Quadratic using the Quadratic Formula, and print the roots to the console.

The structure of your output should look similar to:
```
Input the coefficients for Quadratic Equation f(x):
a = <coefficient 1>
b = <coefficient 2>
c = <coefficient 3>

The Quadratic Equation has the following roots:
root = <calculated root 1>
root = <calculated root 2>
```

Because we cannot successfully compute roots for all Quadratics, we will only test our scripts using a narrow set of coefficients that we can compute so that we do not generate any errors.  You must take user input using the ```input``` function.  Format your output and test your script with the following examples:

```
Input the coefficients for Quadratic Equation f(x):
a = 1
b = 0
c = -1

The Quadratic Equation has the following roots:
root = 1
root = -1
```

```
Input the coefficients for Quadratic Equation f(x):
a = 4
b = -3
c = -2

The Quadratic Equation has the following roots:
root = 1.175390529679106
root = -0.42539052967910607
```

```
Input the coefficients for Quadratic Equation f(x):
a = 2
b = -1
c = -2

The Quadratic Equation has the following roots:
root = 1.2807764064044151
root = -0.7807764064044151
```

#### Exercise 3 - Temperature Conversions

> This exercise uses: **input**, **strings**, and **types**.

Create a script named ```exercise3.py```.

The United States commonly uses the **Fahrenheit** scale. For scientific calculations, **Celsius** is used.
The formula to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius is:

```
C = (F - 32) * 5/9
```

Write a program that takes a **Fahrenheit** temperature as input and prints out the temperature converted to **Celsius**.  

Your program must use the following format for the prompts and output:
```
Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: <input temp>
<input temp> degrees Fahrenheit is <computed temp> degrees Celsius.
```
**IMPORTANT:** The output string **must** be formed by concatenation.

Test your script with **all** of these examples:
```
Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: 32
32.0 degrees Fahrenheit is 0.0 degrees Celsius.
```

```
Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: 212
212.0 degrees Fahrenheit is 100.0 degrees Celsius.
```

```
Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: 72
72.0 degrees Fahrenheit is 22.22222222222222 degrees Celsius.
```

```
Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: -40
-40.0 degrees Fahrenheit is -40.0 degrees Celsius.
```

> Note that the string representations of the numbers suggest the data types used in the calculation.
