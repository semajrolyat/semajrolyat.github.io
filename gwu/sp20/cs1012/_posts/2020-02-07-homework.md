## Homework 2

### Due Date
**This homework is due February 14, 2020 at the end of day.**

## Introduction
We have seen that in drawing the square, we used the same operations multiple times:

```python
from turtle import *
# Length of a side
x = 100

# Draw a square with sides equal to x units
forward(x)
left(90)
forward(x)
left(90)
forward(x)
left(90)
forward(x)

done()
```

Drawing the square is a process of repeatedly drawing an edge and then turning to prepare to draw the next edge.  We can reduce the code needed to draw a square by using a ```for``` loop along with the ```range``` function:
```python
from turtle import *
length = 100
# Draw a square with edges of length
for i in range(4):
    forward(length)
    left(90)

done()
```
A square is a regular polygon --- it is both equilateral and equiangular --- and drawing any regular polygon involves the same basic procedure.

The values used for the angles are determined by the fact that a square is by definition fully enclosed and has four sides of equal length (equilateral).  From this definition, we know a square must also have four angles, _i.e._ an angle between each pair of adjacent edges, of equal degree (equiangular).  

> Recall from trigonometry, if the polygon is equilateral, it must be equiangular due to the direct relationship between side length and angle size.

The degree of the internal angle for a regular polygon is defined by the following formula:

```internal angle = 180(1-2/n)``` where ```n``` is the number of sides.

Therefore, the internal angle for a square is computed as:

```internal angle = 90 (degrees per angle) = 180(1/2) = 180(1-2/4)```

However, consider that in order to turn the turtle with the correct angle, the turtle **does not** turn along the internal angle but turns instead along the external angle.  The following image illustrates how the turtle must turn:

![Turtle turn angle in a regular polygon]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/homework03/polygon-angle.png" | absolute_url }})

This implies that to compute the external angle along which the turtle must turn, we change the internal angle formula to the following:

```external angle = 180 - 180(1-2/n)```

which simplifies to:

```external angle = 360/n```

> This should not be much of a surprise as we have used this same principle when drawing isosceles triangles.

We can generalize the code for drawing a square a step further by computing the turn angle for the turtle, _i.e._ the external angle, using above formula:

```python
from turtle import *

length = 100
angle = 360 / 4
# Draw a square with edges of length
for i in range(4):
    forward(length)
    left(angle)
done()
```

### Homework 2 - Draw a "Honeycomb"
Write a python script named ```homework02.py```.

In this homework, you will write a script that draws a honeycomb pattern using the ```turtle```.  A honeycomb pattern appears when many hexagons are fit together along the walls of the hexagon.  For example, the following image illustrates the honeycomb pattern:

![Honeycomb]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/homework03/honeycomb.png" | absolute_url }})

A hexagon is a regular polygon, so we can use the information in the introduction to draw one or more hexagons.  We will also need to reposition the turtle between drawing a hexagon.  The repetitive process for drawing a set of fit together hexagons is therefore, lower the pen, draw a hexagon, raise the pen, reposition the turtle.

The output of your program must consist of at least three hexagons per row and it must draw at least four rows of adjacent hexagons.  You do not need to worry about the cascading alignment in the previous image and you can instead stair-step in the same direction.  For example, the following image illustrates the minimum requirements for your program:

![Honeycomb Requirements]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/homework03/requirements.png" | absolute_url }})

You must use nested ```for``` loops to draw your honeycomb (There should be three levels of nesting, _i.e._ three nested levels of ```for``` loops): one for "rows", one for "columns", and an inner-most one to draw the hexagon.  _**Your drawing code for the hexagon must not appear more than once within the body of the program**_.  You may need to have additional movement code to reposition the turtle; however, the actual code that draws the hexagon must appear in one place inside the looping control structure(s) that you use to repeatedly draw.  Basically, with the pen up, you can move the turtle freely; however, you must contain the hexagon drawing code in one loop with the pen down and this drawing code can only appear once in the code.

As illustrated above, your program must draw at least four "rows" with three hexagons in a row and each row must be positioned correctly so that a honeycomb pattern emerges.  

For reference, the above images assumed the length of the hexagon side to be 15 units.

### Repositioning for the Next Hex (Drawing a "Column")

After drawing a single hexagon, you will need to advance to the starting position of the next hexagon.  To do so, you can trace along the edges of the current and neighboring hexagons by combining several ```forward```, 'turn' commands, _i.e._ ```left``` and ```right```, and pen control commands, _i.e._ ```penup``` and ```pendown```.  Avoid computing a distance to move forward based on some mathematical function dependent on the size of the hexagon as this process will prove to be inaccurate due to the fractional nature of these computations and the whole number nature of the turtle screen (remember there are types involved).  If you depend on short-cutting this process by computing the distance from the start position of one hex to another, you will add error into the system because the calculations will be real numbers (floats) while the drawing context will be whole numbers (integers).

### Repositioning for the Next Layer (Drawing a "Row")

The code to return to the initial position can be rather complex or simple depending on how you approach the problem.  For the sake of this problem, we will focus on a backtracking approach meaning that you must move backward along the "bottom" edge of the row to reach where you started a row and then move down to the next starting position just like how we advanced to the next hexagon.  This code might seem rather complex, but it can be solved with a set of simple nested loops.

There are other methods available in the turtle library that can greatly simplify this process; however, we will not allow any additional methods to be used other than ```forward```, ```backward```, ```left```, ```right```, ```penup```, and ```pendown```.  To backtrack to the initial position, you may only use a combination of these commands.
