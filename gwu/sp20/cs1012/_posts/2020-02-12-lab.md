## Lab 5

### Instructions

You are allowed to collaborate with your neighbor on these exercises.  Each of you must complete the programming tasks individually; however, you are encouraged to discuss and work together to design a solution to the problems.   It's a good idea to have pen and paper available.

You must include comments in your code.  If you do not include comments, you will only receive partial credit for your solutions.

Before beginning, make sure to create a new folder named ```lab05``` in your class folder.

### New ```turtle``` Command

#### The ```setheading(<angle>)``` command
The ```setheading``` command allows you to set a global orientation for the turtle without the need to use the relative orientation changes via ```left``` and ```right```.  Just like ```left``` and ```right```, ```setheading``` requires you to provide an angle in degrees inside the parentheses; however, the angle is interpreted with respect to the overall screen on a cartesian coordinate system where ```0``` degrees is interpreted as right (east) where positive angles rotate counter-clockwise from the ```0``` orientation and negative angles rotate clockwise from the ```0``` orientation.

For example, to orient the turtle with respect to the cardinal directions East, North, West, and South, we can use ```setheading(0)```, ```setheading(90)```, ```setheading(180)```, and ```setheading(270)``` respectively.

![Cardinal Directions]({{ "/gwu/sp20/cs1012/assets/lab05/setheading-cardinal.png" | absolute_url }})  

Therefore, if we need to move the turtle forward toward the right of the screen, _i.e._ East, we can use ```setheading(0)``` to orient the turtle eastward before making the move.

![Eastwards]({{ "/gwu/sp20/cs1012/assets/lab05/setheading-east.png" | absolute_url }})  

Likewise, if we need to move the turtle forward to toward the top of the screen, _i.e._ North, we can use ```setheading(90)``` to orient the turtle northward before making the move.

![Northwards]({{ "/gwu/sp20/cs1012/assets/lab05/setheading-north.png" | absolute_url }})  

### Exercise 1 -
Create a file named ```exercise1.py```.

You must implement an ```if..else``` statement nested inside a ```for``` loop for your solution to this problem.

Write a program that iterates using a ```for``` loop and moves forward ```50``` units each time it moves forward.  Each pass through the loop, alternate turning left and right so that the turtle follows a 'staircase pattern'.

![Exercise 1 Staircase]({{ "/gwu/sp20/cs1012/assets/lab05/ex1.png" | absolute_url }})  

> Hint: Recall that the topic this week is branching, so your turtle turning is dependent upon alternating states in the loop which can be controlled using an ```if...else``` structure.  The question will be how to switch back and forth between branches which can be accomplished a variety of ways.

### Exercise 2 - Draw a "Spiral"
Create a file named ```exercise2.py```.

You must implement an ```if..elif``` statement consisting of at least four branches nested inside a ```for``` loop for your solution to this problem.

For exercise 2, you will draw the following pattern:

![Exercise 1 Staircase]({{ "/gwu/sp20/cs1012/assets/lab05/ex2.png" | absolute_url }})  

For this exercise, you must use ```setheading``` as described above in order to change the orientation of the turtle.  You can **NOT** use either ```left``` or ```right``` to change direction.

Create a loop that iterates at least ```10``` times.  Inside this loop, you will choose one of the cardinal directions to orient in and you will progressively make longer and longer movements each step through the loop.  If your algorithm for choosing a cardinal direction is well thought out, you can move your turtle in a spiral.

There are four cardinal directions.  Inside your loop, you will build a branching structure that decides which cardinal direction to orient the turtle towards depending on the loop variable.  Each time through the loop, your code will change direction depending on the logic below and the turtle will move forward an accumulated amount called ```length```.  The accumulated amount will be the length it previously moved forward plus a constant change in the length (we might call this ```dlength```).  The constant change in length (```dlength```) should be ```50``` units.    

It should be a bit clear that there is a bit of a disjoint in the logic as there are four cardinal directions, but your loop is expected to iterate significantly more than four times.  The question is how to manage choosing of the next direction.  The easiest way is to relate the orientation of the turtle to the loop variable.  Let's consider this model:

1. If the result of some calculation is 0, move East.
2. Otherwise, if the result of some calculation is 1, move North.
3. Otherwise, if the result of some calculation is 2, move West.
4. Otherwise, if the result of some calculation is 3, move South.

You are probably left wondering what is this magical calculation that yields these numbers and is robust to any integers and not just integers between 0 and 3.  

Well, there are four cardinal directions the remainder of integer division by four is always one of 0,1,2,3.  If you translate the above logic into a python program, you can turn to the East if the remainder of the loop variable divided by four is 0, you can turn to the North if the remainder of the loop variable divided by four is 1, you can turn to the West if the remainder of the loop variable divided by four is 2, etc.   

#### Exercise 3 - Adding Machine
Create a file named ```exercise3.py```.

Old adding machines would take in a sequence of numbers followed by the Enter key and then keep a running total of the sum of the values entered.  In this exercise, we will model this simple concept using Python.

Prompt the user to enter an integer.  If the user enters an integer, add that value to a running total in your program.  If the user presses the Enter key without entering an integer, then the program should print the total and exit.

For example, the following output illustrates the behavior of the program:
```
Enter an integer or press Enter to see the sum? 1
Enter an integer or press Enter to see the sum? 2
Enter an integer or press Enter to see the sum? 3
Enter an integer or press Enter to see the sum?
The sum of all values is 6
```

**Hint**
This is clearly an iterative process; however, you do not know in advance how many times the user will enter a value, so this program should be structured around a ```while``` loop.  There are several ways to express this loop, but the most simple would be to use an "infinite while" loop with a conditional that breaks the loop if the desired break condition arises.
