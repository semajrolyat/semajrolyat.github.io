## Lab 8 Turtle with Input

### Due Date
**The solutions to these exercises must be submitted by the end of the day.**

### Instructions

Before trying to write any code, plan out how you will to use the primitives defined here to draw the solution.  If you don't plan, you may make a mistake and have to start over.  It's a good idea to have pen and paper available.

You are allowed to collaborate with your neighbor on these exercises.  Each of you must complete the programming tasks individually; however, you are encouraged to discuss and work together to design a solution to the problems.

Before beginning, make sure to create a new folder named ```lab08``` in your class folder.

Create a .zip archive containing all of your code files and any written solutions and submit the .zip archive to blackboard as your solutions to these exercises.

You **MUST** include comments in your code.  For each function, you must also provide a block comment that precedes the function and describes every input to the function if it accepts any parameters, what the function does, and what the function returns if it returns a value.  If your code contains no comments, it is incomplete and will not receive credit.  Comments are as important to your code as the code itself.  You must include a comment in the header portion of the file that summarizes what the program does.  You must include comments inline with code to describe the steps in natural language.

#### Goal
In this lab, we will be building a more dynamic, complex program together. Your code will eventually build into one large program. Your program will allow the user to command the turtle using input to draw shapes.

You will write a single program called ```exercise.py```

>```milestone1:``` Basic operations, turtle now has ability to move forward, backward, left, right, penup, pendown

>```milestone2:``` Shapes, turtle now has ability to draw squares, circles, and polygons

>```milestone3:``` Complex shapes, using previous code, turtle now has ability to draw rosette with different shapes

The goal of the lab is to emphasize the importance of **breaking things down into smaller pieces.** This allows us to separate code for
readability, debug pieces of the code in stages rather than fumbling around trying to debug the entire script, and divide and conquer
to build a more complex and well-written script.

#### Template

```Python
'''
Basic Turtle Console Drawing Application

This program takes user input to command the turtle to perform the most basic
drawing operations
'''
from turtle import *
TurtleScreen._RUNNING = True

'''
TODO - Document
'''

def choiceForward():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return
def choiceBackward():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return
def choiceLeft():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return
def choiceRight():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return
def choicePenup():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return
def choicePendown():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return

# ** Beginning of main program **

# Print welcome message
msg = """Welcome to Turtle Console.  This program allows you to command
the Python turtle through the console.
"""
print(smsg)

# Build the menu
smenu = """Draw Menu...
F - moves the turtle forward
B - moves the turtle backward
R - turns the turtle to the right
L - turns the turtle to the left
U - lifts the pen
D - lowers the pen
X - Exits the program

# Main loop - loop forever until user chooses X
while(True):
    # user menu selection
    choice = input(smenu).upper()

    # respond to menu selection
    if choice == "F":
        choiceForward()
    elif choice == "B":
        choiceBackward()
    elif choice == "R":
        choiceRight()
    elif choice == "L":
        choiceLeft()
    elif choice == "U":
        choicePenup()
    elif choice == "D":
        choicePendown()
    elif choice == "X":
        msg = "Exiting.  Please close the window to fully exit the program."
        print(msg)
        break
    else:
        msg = "Invalid input, please try again."
        print(msg)
        continue

done()

```
#### Overview
This program will run until a user enters ```X``` to quit. The simplest strategy
is to use an infinite ```while``` loop with a break conditional.
At every iteration of the loop, the user will be asked to enter a new command.
This includes all of the basic turtle functions for moving and changing angles,
with the inclusion of drawing polygons.


#### Milestone 1
This exercise should contain code to do the following basic turtle functions:
1. forward
2. backward
3. left
4. right
5. penup
6. pendown

These functions can be represented as if/elif condtionals in the while loop.

>**Remember:** what parameters do each of these functions need? How should we acquire
this information?

#### Milestone 2
This exercise adds these abilities to exercise1:
1. square
2. polygon
3. circle

>circle can be put in an if/elif condtional for this exercise, but square and
polygon **must** be defined functions before the loop.

#### Milestone 3
For milestone we will add the ability to draw a _**rosette**_.  Recall in lab 2 when we wrote a function to draw a flower like structure using circles:

![lab2ex2]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/lab02/circles.png" | absolute_url }})

This function should be able to draw a polygon of any shape and should no longer be limited to drawing only with circles.

1. square
2. polygon
3. circle

This exercise takes everything done in exercise1 / exercise2 and defines them as
function. forward, backward, polygon, rosette etc. *must* be contained within
functions. Rather than writing the verbose code within the while loop, we can
simply check the user input as an if/elif conditional and call the appropriate
function to handle their request. We will also add in the rosette function to
draw more complex shapes.
