## Lab 8 Turtle with Input

### Due Date
**The solutions to these exercises must be submitted by the end of the day.**

### Instructions

Before trying to write any code, plan out how you will to use the primitives defined here to draw the solution.  If you don't plan, you may make a mistake and have to start over.  It's a good idea to have pen and paper available.

You are allowed to collaborate with your neighbor on these exercises.  Each of you must complete the programming tasks individually; however, you are encouraged to discuss and work together to design a solution to the problems.

Before beginning, make sure to create a new folder named ```lab08``` in your class folder.

Create a .zip archive containing all of your code files and any written solutions and submit the .zip archive to blackboard as your solutions to these exercises.

You **MUST** include comments in your code.  For each function, you must also provide a block comment that precedes the function and describes every input to the function if it accepts any parameters, what the function does, and what the function returns if it returns a value.  If your code contains no comments, it is incomplete and will not receive credit.  Comments are as important to your code as the code itself.  You must include a comment in the header portion of the file that summarizes what the program does.  You must include comments inline with code to describe the steps in natural language.

#### Goal
In this lab, we will be building a more dynamic, complex program together. Your code will eventually build into one large program. Your program will allow the user to command the turtle using input to draw shapes.

You will write a single program called ```exercise.py```

>```milestone1:``` Basic operations, turtle now has ability to move forward, backward, left, right, penup, pendown

>```milestone2:``` Shapes, turtle now has ability to draw squares, circles, and polygons

>```milestone3:``` Complex shapes, using previous code, turtle now has ability to draw rosette with different shapes

The goal of the lab is to emphasize the importance of **breaking things down into smaller pieces.** This allows us to separate code for
readability, debug pieces of the code in stages rather than fumbling around trying to debug the entire script, and divide and conquer
to build a more complex and well-written script.

#### Template

```Python
'''
Basic Turtle Console Drawing Application

This program takes user input to command the turtle to perform the most basic
drawing operations
'''
from turtle import *
TurtleScreen._RUNNING = True

'''
TODO - Document
'''

def choiceForward():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return
def choiceBackward():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return
def choiceLeft():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return
def choiceRight():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return
def choicePenup():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return
def choicePendown():
    # TODO: Fill in this function
    return

# ** Beginning of main program **

# Print welcome message
msg = """Welcome to Turtle Console.  This program allows you to command
the Python turtle through the console.
"""
print(smsg)

# Build the menu
smenu = """Draw Menu...
F - moves the turtle forward
B - moves the turtle backward
R - turns the turtle to the right
L - turns the turtle to the left
U - lifts the pen

# Main loop - loop forever until user chooses X
while(True):
    # user menu selection
    choice = input(smenu).upper()

    # respond to menu selection
    if choice == "F":
        choiceForward()
    elif choice == "B":
        choiceBackward()
    elif choice == "R":
        choiceRight()
    elif choice == "L":
        choiceLeft()
    elif choice == "U":
        choicePenup()
    elif choice == "D":
        choicePendown()
    elif choice == "X":
        msg = "Exiting.  Please close the window to fully exit the program."
        print(msg)
        break
    else:
        msg = "Invalid input, please try again."
        print(msg)
        continue

done()

```
## Overview
This program will run until a user enters ```X``` to quit. The simplest strategy
is to use an infinite ```while``` loop with a break conditional.
At every iteration of the loop, the user will be asked to enter a new command.
This includes all of the basic turtle functions for moving and changing angles,
with the inclusion of drawing polygons.

In the template, you will find a framework that ties the menu to functions where you can easily insert corresponding functionality.  However, before focusing on the individual tasks, first look at the overall program structure and note how the ```choice``` functions are linked into the main program through ```if/elif``` conditionals in the ```while``` loop.

### Adding the Forward feature

This program primarily ties the console to the turtle window which allows us to issue commands directly to the turtle.  Remember that every function we use might take parameters that must be provided when the function is called.  For example, the turtle's ```forward``` function requires a ```distance``` parameter.  

When a menu choice is made by the user, a corresponding ```choice``` function is called.  In the respective ```choice``` function, we need to ask the user additional questions in order to get any necessary parameters. For example, for the ```choiceForward``` function, the process might look like the following:

```Python
def choiceForward():
    sprompt = "Move Forward how many units? "
    distance = int(input(sprompt))
    forward(distance)
```

## Milestone 1

The first set of tasks is to implement the existing ```choice``` functions for each of the following operations:

1. forward
2. backward
3. left
4. right
5. penup
6. pendown

These are the most basic ```turtle``` commands which you should be readily familiar with.  Follow along with the instructor and fill in each ```choice``` functions with code to support these operations.

## Milestone 2

We are not limited to the primitive drawing operations from Milestone 1.  We have explored code for a variety of shapes that we may want to draw with a few keystrokes.  In this set of tasks, we will add in menu choices and drawing functions that allow us to draw the following shapes:

1. square
2. circle
3. polygon

Focus on getting each of these working one at a time and test each one when you write it.

You should add independent functions for drawing shapes and avoid embedding this functionality inside a ```choice``` function.  Allow the ```choice``` function to call the ```drawing``` function.  

Why?  Because we want to maximize reusability especially with regard to the drawing functions.  The ```choice``` functions should be loosely bound to the ```drawing``` operations and we may want to reuse ```drawing``` code frequently while the ```choice``` functions are very specialized.   

## Milestone 3
For this milestone, we will add the ability to draw a _**rosette**_.  Recall in lab 2 when we wrote a function to draw a flower like structure using circles:

![lab2ex2]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/lab02/circles.png" | absolute_url }})

This function should be able to draw a polygon of any shape and should no longer be limited to drawing only with circles.

What other features have we developed during this term?:  The isosceles right triangle, the honeycomb, the house, etc.  You can now put together all of these individual tasks into one drawing program.  We want to see the rosette in your program; however, if you have some time in the next week, you are also encouraged to take this program further.

Submit ```exercise.py```
