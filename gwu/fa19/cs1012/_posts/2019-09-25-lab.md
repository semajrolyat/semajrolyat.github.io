## Lab 5

### Due Date
**The solutions to these exercises must be submitted by the end of the day.**

### Instructions

Before trying to write any code, plan out how you will to use the primitives defined here to draw the solution.  If you don't plan, you may make a mistake and have to start over.  It's a good idea to have pen and paper available.

You are allowed to collaborate with your neighbor on these exercises.  Each of you must complete the programming tasks individually; however, you are encouraged to discuss and work together to design a solution to the problems.

Before beginning, make sure to create a new folder named ```lab05``` in your class folder.

Create a .zip archive containing all of your code files and submit the .zip archive to blackboard as your solutions to these exercises.

### Exercise 1 - Month of the year
> This exercise will allow you to work with input, strings, and formatted output.

Create a script named ```exercise1.py```.

Write a program that iterates using a ```for``` loop which prints the number indicating the month of the year and the corresponding name of the month.

Create a list composed of the strings ```"January"```, ```"February"```, ```"March"```, ```"April"```, ```"May"```, ```"June"```, ```"July"```, ```"August"```, ```"September"```, ```"October"```, ```"November"```, and ```"December",```.  Each iteration through the loop, print out a number indicating the numeric month of the year and the name of the month.  For example, your program should produce the following output:

```
Month 1 of the year is January
Month 2 of the year is February
Month 3 of the year is March
Month 4 of the year is April
Month 5 of the year is May
Month 6 of the year is June
Month 7 of the year is July
Month 8 of the year is August
Month 9 of the year is September
Month 10 of the year is October
Month 11 of the year is November
Month 12 of the year is December
```

You will submit ```exercise1.py```.

### Exercise 2 - Multiplication Table

Create a script named ```exercise2.py```.

In this exercise, you will use nested ```for``` loops and string concatenation to compute the multiplication table up to and including factors of ``12``.  

> A "nested" loop is a loop inside a loop.

A multiplication table includes rows and columns.  Each cell in the table represents the product of the current row factor and the current column factor.  You may print only the products for your table and do not have to print the factors as the headings of the rows and columns.

Each pass through the "inner" loop, compute the product between the current row and column factors and concatenate the product into a string representing the current row.  Once all products for a row have been computed, print the row to the console.

Formatting a string containing a set of numbers as a consistently organized table can be a little difficult.  Each number may have a different length, so columns may not line up.  To simplify the formatting and produce consistent tables, insert a tab character between each product while building the string for a row.  

>The ```\t``` character combination inside a string is interpreted as the tab character by Python just like the ```"\n"``` character combination in interpreted as a newline character.   

Your program should produce the following output:
```
1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9       10       11       12       
2       4       6       8       10      12      14      16      18      20       22       24       
3       6       9       12      15      18      21      24      27      30       33       36       
4       8       12      16      20      24      28      32      36      40       44       48       
5       10      15      20      25      30      35      40      45      50       55       60       
6       12      18      24      30      36      42      48      54      60       66       72       
7       14      21      28      35      42      49      56      63      70       77       84       
8       16      24      32      40      48      56      64      72      80       88       96       
9       18      27      36      45      54      63      72      81      90       99       108       
10      20      30      40      50      60      70      80      90      100      110      120       
11      22      33      44      55      66      77      88      99      110      121      132       
12      24      36      48      60      72      84      96      108     120      132      144   
```

You will submit ```exercise2.py```.

#### Exercise 3 - Sum All Positive, Even Integers from 50 to 100    -> [50, 100)

Create a script named ```exercise3.py```.

Write a script that computes the sum of all positive even integers from 50 to but **not including** 100 and prints the total sum after the computation finishes.  You must use a ```for``` loop with the ```range``` function to perform this computation.  

Your program should produce the following output:
```
1850
```

You will submit ```exercise3.py```.
