## Introduction
In class, you were introduced to writing a simple program using the Interactive Python Prompt.  We will primarily use a more sophisticated interface to write and execute Python programs; however, you should still familiarize yourself with interacting with Python using the interactive prompt.  In the environment that we will use, you will find multiple windows that present different tools and information.  One of these windows is an interactive prompt and we will conduct a simple exercise using it; however, we will quickly transition to writing less tenuous programs as scripts.

### Goals
The goals of today's lab are to install and use all the tools that you will use throughout the semester so that you are familiarized enough to work on future labwork and homework.  We will also write a few very simple programs based on the discussion from this week as an introductory exercise.  Specifically, we will:
* Install Anaconda, a Python distribution
* Learn how to open and use ```spyder```, a python IDE included in Anaconda
* Write a few simple programs using the interactive prompt in ```spyder```
* Write a Python script that we can save and rerun later
* Learn how to archive files using zip so that you can submit them to blackboard  

## Installing Anaconda
You will need to download and install **Anaconda 3** from the following url... [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  Make sure to choose the correct installer for your operating system.  Also make sure to select **Anaconda 3** as the earlier version will not be compatible with this class.

> If you are having any difficulty installing Anaconda, please make sure to get assistance as soon as possible.  You must leave lab today with a working installation of Anaconda.

### Interactive Development Environment
An Interactive Development Environment (IDE) is a program that provides a number of tools for developers.  An IDE is usually focused around a text editor that allows a programmer to easily write new scripts and to load scripts from disk for editing.  An IDE also typically provides other tools such as a way to run a script, to view output, and a terminal in which the programmer can interact with a running script.  Anaconda provides access to a number of IDEs of varying quality.

For this class, we will use **spyder** as our preferred IDE which is available through Anaconda and is already available on all lab computers.

#### Launching spyder
Follow the instructions for your operating system.
##### Windows
> These instructions will launch spyder on the lab computers without any additional configuration.
Open the Anaconda Prompt from the *Start Menu*.  In the Anaconda Prompt, enter the following command:
```
$ spyder
```
This should launch spyder

> Remember, don't type the ```$```.  The ```$``` symbol is to remind you that you need to type the command in the Anaconda Prompt.

##### MacOSX
> These instructions should work on your laptop.  If they do not, use your lab computer and follow the Windows instructions above; however, notify your instructor.
Open the Terminal.  Enter the following command in the terminal:
```
$ spyder
```
This should launch spyder

> Remember, don't type the ```$```.  The ```$``` symbol is to remind you that you need to type the command in the Terminal prompt.

### Intro to spyder
The spyder IDE should look like the following image:

![spyder IDE]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/lab01/spyder.png" | absolute_url }})

The left hand pane contains a text editor and the bottom right hand pane contains a Python interactive prompt.  There are other features that we might use later, but these basic elements are all you need to write and run a Python program in spyder.

You can type in both the editor and the interactive prompt.  The editor allows you to write a Python script, save it using the controls along the top, and run the script by clicking the *PLAY* button along the toolbar at the top.  The interactive prompt allows you to interact directly with the python kernel which as long as spyder remains open update the state of Python.

> Don't get to confused by the terms state and kernel.  We will talk about it later.  The key concept is that when you open spyder, you are running a Python server in the background which you can talk to using either a program or the interactive prompt.    

When you write a script in the editor, you can save the script to your hard drive.  You can then open the script again later using the corresponding menu operation.  You should recognize that this lets you reuse scripts again and again and is the primary focus of 'writing' scripts/programs and is the principle activity of programming.  

> Save your files in a consistent directory that you can easily find later.  I suggest you create a folder on your desktop named ```cs1012```.  Each class, create a new folder inside the ```cs1012``` folder using either the class date, the day's topic, or the exercise or homework identifier as the folder name.  Save all your work in the appropriate folder.  When you submit your work, you can simply zip that work folder and submit the zip file.

### Exercise 1

The most basic program that a programmer starts with when learning a new language is called 'Hello World'.  Hello World is a very simple program that instructs the system to print 'Hello World'.  This program helps us verify that a programming environment is correctly set up and teaches us the basic operation of printing output.  Generating output in general is incredibly important (a program the does not produce output is effectively useless) and printing is the most basic form of output.    

For this exercise, write the following program into the interactive prompt:

```Python
print("Hello World!")
```
When you hit return, the interactive prompt should respond with:
```
Hello World!
```

> If your program does not print "Hello World!" either you made a syntactical mistake (spelling or missing tokens like quotes or parentheses) or there is a problem with your installation.  Double check that the command that you issued to the prompt matches the above program and if it does, seek help from an instructor.

### Exercise 2

Earlier this week, we discussed how to draw a square.  The instructions for drawing the square are in the weekly discussion.  For this exercise, you will draw a square using the interactive prompt.

> We showed you drawing in a terminal window; however, you can issue the same commands in the spyder interactive prompt.  In the future, examples will be shown in spyder, so you do not need to worry about learning to use the terminal.

Your program should instruct the turtle to draw a square similar to the following image:

![Exercise 2 Square]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/lab01/exercise02.png" | absolute_url }})


## Writing a Python Script
While we can accomplish a lot using the Interactive Python Prompt, writing a program entirely at the prompt poses a number of problems:
* Mistakes are costly.  If you make a mistake, it can be difficult to correct without starting over.
* To run a program more than once using the Interactive Python Prompt, you have to rewrite the program which opens up the possibility of making a new mistake each time you write the program.  It is also time consuming to rewrite a program over and over.

Instead of writing code at the Interactive Python Prompt, we can instead write a Python program, typically called a script and run the script at a shell prompt or we can write a script in an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) and run the script inside the environment.  

> A Python script must have the file extension `.py`.

From here on out, write your python code into the editor window on the left side and not at the interactive prompt.

### spyder and the turtle
The window in which the turtle draws can be a bit cantankerous.  There are two issues that can regularly come up when using the ```turtle``` module in spyder.
1. The window may be difficult to close
2. When running a ```turtle``` program a second time, the system may generate an error and fail.

The following guidelines will help resolve these two issues.

> You will probably want to refer back to these guidelines for a few weeks.  We will be drawing quite a bit with the turtle and these little issues will crop up each time.

#### Making the ```turtle``` window more friendly
At the end of a ```turtle``` program, call the ```done()``` command.

The reason the ```turtle``` window does not wish to close is the window is waiting for more instructions.  If the ```done()``` command is the last instruction in the script, the window is notified that there will be no more instructions.  As a result, it will be easier to close.

The following script shows how to use ```done()```:
```python
from turtle import *

forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)

done()       # this needs to be the last instruction in every turtle program
```

#### Preventing the second run error
This error is also obscure and is caused by a similar reason as the previous.  You may not have the bug on your system; however, the solution provided here should prevent the bug if your program is run on another system.

> Bugs can be introduced in different versions of software.  This issue appears to be resolved in Python 3.6 and later.  It is important to keep your software updated for this reason.

The bug is primarily due to the ```turtle``` window not being fully unloaded when it is run a first time.  When ```turtle``` is run a second time, this causes an error in the window which causes the window to be fully unloaded.  Practically, this means that every other time you try to run a ```turtle``` program, it will error which can mislead a programmer into believing that the error is in the program and not due to the environment.

Fortunately, the solution is rather simple...  instead of using just the following statement at the beginning of a turtle script:
```python
from turtle import *
```

Use the following two statements together:
```python
from turtle import *
TurtleScreen._RUNNING = True
```

### Analysis

Another important programming task is analyzing a problem and determining a strategy to solve to problem.  Effective programming does not involve blindly guessing and is a deeply analytical process.  

Before trying to write any code, plan out how you will to use the primitive commands to draw the solution.  If you don't plan, you may make a mistake and have to start over.  It's a good idea to have pen and paper available.

### Submissions

When submitting an answer to blackboard, from this point on, you will need to submit your python source file (the ```.py``` file you write).  You may also need to take a screenshot of a solution, save the screenshot, and submit the screenshot as a part of your solution.  You must submit the set of all files as a single ```.zip``` file to blackboard for a lab or homework exercise.

#### Create a Lab Folder

You will need to be able to find the folder in which you store your work.  It's usually best to create a new folder for each assignment so that all the files are grouped together in one location and are not easily confused with other files that may have similar names.  Inside the ```cs1012``` folder, create a ```lab01``` folder and store any files for the remaining exercise in the ```lab01``` folder.

#### Taking Screenshots

To take a screenshot of a window:
* (Windows) hold **Alt+PrtSc**
* (Mac) hold down **Cmd+Shift+4**

Taking a screenshot on a Mac typically automatically stores the screenshot in your ```Pictures``` folder.  

Taking a screenshot on Windows typically only stores the image to the clipboard.  To save the screenshot, you typically need to open an image program like ```paint```, paste the image into ```paint```, and then save the image to the desired directory.  

#### Creating a ```.zip``` Archive
A ```.zip``` file is a file that can contain many files inside a single file.  One both Mac and Windows, you can generally create a ```.zip``` file by "right" clicking a folder and choosing an option on the menu.  The option may be listed as ```compress``` or ```send to... compressed folder```, or may refer explictly to zipping.

> If you need help with zipping a folder, ask an instructor for assistance.

### Due Date
**The solutions to these exercises must be submitted by the end of the day.**

### Exercise 3 - Scripting a Centered Square
In the discussion, we learned how to draw a square; however, the square was not centered in the middle of the screen.  By default the turtle starts at the origin (the screen center).  If we wish to center the square about the origin, we need to position the turtle before we start drawing.  Recall that we have 6 commands available: ```forward```, ```backward```, ```left```, ```right```, ```penup```, and ```pendown```.

The square our example is not centered in the middle of the canvas.  Using the statements described above, how can you draw the same square centered in the canvas?  The turtle should end up in the same corner of the square and with the same orientation as in the example.

Draw the square.  The result should look like the following image:

![Exercise 3 Square]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/lab01/exercise03.png" | absolute_url }})

Save a screenshot of your solution as ```exercise3.png```.
