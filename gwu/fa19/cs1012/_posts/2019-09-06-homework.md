## Homework 1

### Due Date
**This homework is due September 13, 2019 at the end of day.**

<!--
## Readability
Over the coming weeks, we will talk about readability in class; however, there are two important tools that we rely on to make it easier for someone to understand a long and complex program.  These tools are adding comments to code and the judicious use of whitespace.

#### Comments
Comments are text information that Python ignores.  A comment is indicated to Python by the hash/pound symbol, ```#```.  Any text to the right of the hash/pound symbol will be ignored by Python.  While a comment can be placed on any line of code, it is typically recommended to start the comment at the left margin and to avoid adding comments to the right of code.  For example, the following code snippet illustrates basic commenting:

```python
# This whole line is a comment
from turtle import *  # This comment falls to the right of a line of code
```

Remember that reading code is generally a non-productive task.  You may revisit code that you have previously written or you may review code written by someone else.  The gap between you revisiting code may be months or even years.  By commenting, you can add information  

#### Whitespace
In addition to comments, whitespace can greatly enhance readability.  Whitespace typically includes the 'return' character, the 'tab' character, and the 'space' character.  When you press one of the corresponding whitespace keys on the keyboard, a non-visible character is embedded into document in order to represent that character.  Repeated whitespace is generally ignored by Python meaning that pressing the 'Return' key several times in a row will print multiple return characters into the document but will be interpreted as a single return character by Python.

Whitespace can greatly improve the readability of code.  Long blocks of code without any visual break can be difficult to read especially when many commands are repeated frequently.  All it takes is to look away from a monolithic block of code for a moment to lose one's place.  However, we do not want to arbitrarily add whitespace that lengthens a document but does not add useful visual cues or information.  For this reason

## Homework 1 - Draw a House
Write a python script named ```homework01.py``` that draws a house.  

You may draw the house with whatever dimensions you choose; however, it must have the following general characteristics:  a pitched (triangular) roof, a centered door, two rectangular windows (one on either side of the door), and a circular decorative window centered over the door and located in the pitched roof.  

You may embellish the house and the overall scene with whatever additional decorations and detail that you choose; however, the house must have all of the stated characteristics in order to receive full credit.  The turtle can end up anywhere you choose and can even serve as a decoration itself, _e.g._ a door knocker.  

For example, your house should generally look like the following:

![Homework 1 House]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/homework01/house.png" | absolute_url }})

### Submission
Take a screenshot of your house and save it as ```homework01.png```.  Create a zip file containing both ```homework01.py``` and ```homework01.py``` and submit the zip file before the end of next Friday (September 13, 2019)
