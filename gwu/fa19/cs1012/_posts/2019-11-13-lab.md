## Lab 11 Modules

### Due Date
**The solutions to these exercises must be submitted by the end of the day.**

### Instructions

You are allowed to collaborate with your neighbor on these exercises.  Each of you must complete the programming tasks individually; however, you are encouraged to discuss and work together to design a solution to the problems.

Create a .zip archive containing all of your code files and any written solutions and submit the .zip archive to blackboard as your solutions to these exercises.

You **MUST** include comments in your code.  For each function, you must also provide a block comment that precedes the function and describes every input to the function if it accepts any parameters, what the function does, and what the function returns if it returns a value.  If your code contains no comments, it is incomplete and will not receive credit.  Comments are as important to your code as the code itself.  You must include a comment in the header portion of the file that summarizes what the program does.  You must include comments inline with code to describe the steps in natural language.

#### Exercise 1 - Random value between two floats
Create a file named ```exercise1.py```.

Write a function that computes the average of a list of numbers.

Your function must have the following definition where ```low``` is the lower bound, and ```high``` is the upper bound. Your function must return a randomly generated float between the lower and upper bound:
```python
def randomfloat(low, high):
```

To test your program, make a for loop that calls ``randomFloat`` 100 times in the range [-1000, 1000). If your function returns anything that isn't in that range, print the float to the console.


Submit ```exercise1.py```.


#### Exercise 2 - Rolling 2 dice
Write a script to simulate rolling 2 six-sided dice.

Write two functions named ``rolldie`` and ``roll2dice``. ``rolldie`` takes no parameters and returns a random value in the range from 1 to 6. ``roll2dice`` takes no parameters and returns no values; however, roll2dice prints the outcome of rolling two individual dice with the following format:

```python
<valueofdie1> <valueofdie2>
```

For example, if the values produced by rolling two dice is 5 and 3, roll2dice will print:

```python
5 3
```

Your main program should test roll2dice by iterating 10 times and calling roll2dice each time. Confirm that the outcome of each throw produces a pair of values with the total of each pair in the range of [2, 12]. If the total value is not within this range, print to the console indicating an error. *This is for your own testing purposes*

Submit ```exercise2.py```.


#### Exercise 3 - Math Module
Create a file named ```exercise3.py```.

Write a function that returns the area of a circle circumscribed by a square, based on a sidelength. You have done similar exercises in the past.
> Hint: using Math.pi and Math.sqrt, how can you relate the square dimensions with the circle?

visualization:

![spyder IDE]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1012/assets/lab11/circle_square.png" | absolute_url }})


Your function must have the following definition where ```sidelength``` is the length of the square's side.

```python
def circleArea(sidelength):
```


Run these test calls to validate your ```circleArea``` function:

```python

print (circleArea(5))
print (circleArea(7))
print (circleArea(22))
```

This program should produce the following output:
```
39.26990816987242
76.96902001294993
760.2654221687299
```



Submit ```exercise3.py```.
