# Lab 6 - Cryptography

## Introduction

Cryptography or cryptology is the study of secrete communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries.  The goal of cryptography is to mask communication from third parties so that they may not access communications.

### Applications

The applications of cryptography are wide ranging. For example military units must pass secure commands during operations, banks must transfer monetary information without interception, and browsers must establish secure connections to prevent monitoring of information transferred.

### Terminology

The first use of the term cryptography is dated back to the 19th century and originates from a novel by Edgar Allen Poe called Gold-Bug.  At the time, the term cryptography exclusively referred to as _**encryption**_, which is converting ordinary information called _**plain text**_ to an unintelligible form called _**cipher text**_, and _**decryption**_, which is the process of reversing encryption process to retrieve the original information.  A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that creates both the encryption and decryption processes.  Both of these processes are controlled by a _**key**_ which is the secret known only by the communicators that controls the cipher operations.


### A Classic Example of Cryptography
Before the modern era, cryptography referred to the sending confidential messages.  Mainly this was focused on making text into something incomprehensible (encryption) and then converting the incomprehensible text back to the original message (decryption).  An example of such a process is the alphabet shift cipher.  

The alphabet shift cipher is also known as the Caesar cipher and relies on a simple encryption and decryption scheme.  This scheme is to shift each character in the message by a constant offset.  To encrypt, we shift a character in the plain text by the desired offset in one direction to form the cipher text, and to decrypt, we shift a character in the cipher text in the opposite direction by the same offset.  For example, if we use an offset of 3, A becomes D during encryption and D becomes A during encryption.  The secrets involved in this process are the offset and the direction of the shift.

### A Modern Example of Cryptography

We are not limited to sending text information with cryptography.  We may apply the same principles to the process of image based communication. To send a secret messages as single image, we need to have a key.  In this lab, we will examine three different methods for performing cryptography on images.  This particular application of cryptography is called _**steganography**_.

# Caesar Cipher Implementation

The idea of the alphabet shift cipher is attributed to Julius Caesar hence the name Caesar cipher.  The encryption process involves shifting all letters in the plain text in one direction by an offset which acts as the key.  In order for the message to be encrypted, the value of the key must be greater than 0 and less than the number of characters in the alphabet.  

## Caesar Function
First create a function called ```caesar``` which accepts two variables and will perform both encryption and decryption on a message.  For example:

```python
def caesar(text, key):
    msg = ""
    text = text.upper()
    sign = 1
    if key < 0:
        sign = -1
        key *= sign;
    if key > 26:
        key %= 26
```

## Alphabet Shift Encryption

This part calculates the Unicode code of each character using the built-in function ord(), the reason is we need to add an integer to shift each character in the direction we need, also special characters such as white space, !?., stay the same, hence we use Unicode code to create this condition easily. Then we add the key to Unicode of each character. Built-in function chr() convert the encrypted Unicode to encrypted character, which is the format we need to show the encrypted string. We synthesize the string by concatenate the Unicode or each character, variable str stores the characters.

```python
for i in range(0, len(text)):
    if text[i].isalpha():
        x = ord(text[i]) - ord("A")
        x = (x + sign * key) % 26
        msg += chr(x + ord("A"))
    else:
        msg += text[i]
return msg
```

We can call ```caesar``` with either plain text or cipher text:

```python
plaintxt = 'A SAMPLE TEXT Z'
# Change key as you wish
key = 10
ciphertxt = caesar(plaintxt, key)
msg = caesar(ciphertxt, key*-1)

print(plaintxt)
print(ciphertxt)
print(msg)
```


# Encrypt & Decrypt an Image

We use three different method to generate a key to encrypt and decrypt an image.

For all encryption and decryption method of this lab you need to use python image library ```PIL```. To show the encrypted and decrypted image you should use ```matplotlib```.


```Python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Original Image

```Python
im = Image.open("myimage.png")
originalpix = np.array(im)
ax0 = fig.add_subplot(221)
ax0.set_title('Original Image', fontsize=9)
plt.imshow(originalpix)
```

## Gray Image

```Python
im2 = im.convert("L")
pix = np.array(im2)
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(222)
ax1.set_title('Grayscale Image', fontsize=9)
plt.imshow(pix, cmap='gray')
```

### Method-1: Adding a Constant Integer to Original Image Pixels

#### Encryption Method

Arithmetic mod (%) is widely used in cryptography, the reason is we can guarantee the largest values are still can be hold in the size we allocate per pixel.

```Python
key = 150
for i in range(pix.shape[0]):
    for j in range(pix.shape[1]):
        pix[i, j] = (pix[i, j] + key) % 256

ax2 = fig.add_subplot(223)
ax2.set_title('Encrypted Image', fontsize=9)
plt.imshow(pix, cmap='gray')
```
#### Decryption Method

```Python
for i in range(pix.shape[0]):
    for j in range(pix.shape[1]):
        pix[i, j] = (pix[i, j] - key) % 256

ax3 = fig.add_subplot(224)
ax3.set_title('Decrypted Image', fontsize=9)
plt.imshow(pix, cmap='gray')
```

#### Show all images

```Python
plt.show()
```

### Method-2: Adding Randomly Generated Image to Original Image Pixels

#### Key Image

```Python
k = np.zeros((pix.shape[0], pix.shape[1]))
for i in range(pix.shape[0]):
    for j in range(pix.shape[1]):
        k[i, j] = 255 * random.uniform(0, 1)


ax2 = fig.add_subplot(324)
ax2.set_title('Grayscale Key Image', fontsize=9)
plt.imshow(k, cmap='gray')
```
#### Encyption Method

```Python
for i in range(pix.shape[0]):
    for j in range(pix.shape[1]):
        pix[i, j] = (pix[i, j] + k[i, j]) % 256

ax3 = fig.add_subplot(325)
ax3.set_title('Decrypted Image', fontsize=9)
plt.imshow(pix, cmap='gray')
```

#### Decryption Method

```Python
for i in range(pix.shape[0]):
    for j in range(pix.shape[1]):
        pix[i, j] = (pix[i, j] - k[i, j]) % 256

ax3 = fig.add_subplot(326)
ax3.set_title('Encrypted Image', fontsize=9)
plt.imshow(pix, cmap='gray')
```
#### Show all images

```Python
plt.show()
```
### Method-3: Adding a Key Image to Original Image Pixels

We can replace the uniformly random generated image with a noisy secondary image such as a carpet. Try to use a key image to encrypt your image and compare the results with the previous methods.
<!--
#### Key Image

```Python
im1 = Image.open("mykeyimage.png")
im1_gray = im1.convert("L")
key_image = np.array(im1_gray, dtype="int16")

ax2 = fig.add_subplot(324)
ax2.set_title('Grayscale Key Image', fontsize=9)
plt.imshow(key_image, cmap='gray')
```
#### Encyption Method

```Python
for i in range(pix.shape[0]):
    for j in range(pix.shape[1]):
        pix[i, j] = (pix[i, j] + key_image[i, j]) % 256

ax3 = fig.add_subplot(325)
ax3.set_title('Decrypted Image', fontsize=9)
plt.imshow(pix, cmap='gray')
```

#### Decryption Method

```Python
for i in range(pix.shape[0]):
    for j in range(pix.shape[1]):
        pix[i, j] = (pix[i, j] - key_image[i, j]) % 256

ax3 = fig.add_subplot(326)
ax3.set_title('Encrypted Image', fontsize=9)
plt.imshow(pix, cmap='gray')
```

#### Show all images

```Python
plt.show()
```

### Exercise

The exclusive OR operation (i.e., ^ bitwise exclusive XOR) is applied to binary bits, like AND, OR, and NOT. This operation is fundamental encryption technique. Below is an example of XOR on two binary variables:

```Python
bin(11100 ^ 11001)
```
Output: '0b110100101'

1. Use XOR funtion as encryption and decryption operator for an image for all three methods you have learned in the lab.
