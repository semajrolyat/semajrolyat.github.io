# Lab 3 - Basic Device Development

## Introduction

This week we will work with an Arduino, a simple, programmable micro-controller that we can combine with a variety of sensors (see [Introduction to Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction)).  The Arduino platform is very popular among hobbyists and developers because it can be used to model or as a basic platform to base or prototype a simple, interactive device.

Ultrasonic sensors...

## Components

A _**breadboard**_ allows us to quickly and safely model a circuit using connectors that do not require soldering.  The breadboard is an insulated block with interconnected wiring runs that can be interconnected using a variety of electronic components.

_**Jumper wires**_ are low voltage conductors with connectors that can easily interconnect components.  Jumper wires may have different end connectors that facilitate interconnection with a component or a breadboard without the need for soldering.

**If your Arduino is connected to a USB port, unplug the USB before proceeding.**
In general **NEVER** connect power before connecting the ground.

Using jumper wires, connect the ports on the Arduino board to the socket on the breadboard that corresponds to the correct ultrasonic sensor pin in the following order:
1. Connect a ground on the Arduino board to the ground pin (Gnd) on the ultrasonic sensor.
2. Connect power on the Arduino board to the power pin (Vcc) on the ultrasonic sensor.
3. Connect port 2 on the Arduino board to the echo pin (Echo) on the ultrasonic sensor.
4. Connect port 3 on the Arduino board to the trigger pin (Trig) on the ultrasonic sensor.

Your wiring should match the following diagram:
