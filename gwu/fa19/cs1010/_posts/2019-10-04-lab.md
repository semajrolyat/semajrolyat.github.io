# Lab 3 - Basic Device Development

## Introduction

This week we will work with an Arduino, a simple, programmable micro-controller that we can combine with a variety of sensors (see [Introduction to Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction)).  The Arduino platform is very popular among hobbyists and developers because it can be used to model or as a basic platform to base or prototype a simple, interactive device.

## Components

A _**breadboard**_ allows us to quickly and safely model a circuit using connectors that do not require soldering.  The breadboard is an insulated block with interconnected wiring runs that can be interconnected using a variety of electronic components.

_**Jumper wires**_ are low voltage conductors with connectors that can easily interconnect components.  Jumper wires may have different end connectors that facilitate interconnection with a component or a breadboard without the need for soldering.
