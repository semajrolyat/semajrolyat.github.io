# Lab 2 - Basic Data Analysis

## Introduction

This week we will work with the ```numpy``` and ```matplotlib``` modules.  These modules are included in a number of Python libraries and are widely used by an even broader set of Python libraries to manipulate, parameterize, and visualize data.  

The ```numpy``` module contains a powerful set of tools that allow us to manipulate large sets of data using a small set of statements.  The goal of ```numpy``` is to model data manipulation operations that can be found in other mathematical programming environments like MatLab, and some of the ```numpy``` syntax and functions are inspired by established MatLab approaches to make transition easier; however, there are some significant differences between the two that prohibit direct translation from Python to MatLab and vice-versa.

The ```matplotlib``` module contains a number of plotting functions that allow data to be visualized using a variety of plotting approaches, _e.g._ line plot, scatter plot, histogram, etc.  ```matplotlib``` can accept the data stored in ```numpy``` data structures, so these two libraries typically work hand-in-hand.

## Scenario

Let's motivate exploration of these modules using the basic data analysis problem of computing grades for a fictional class.  In this fictional class, the overall grade is calculated based on a number of quizzes, homework exercises, and exams.  In the syllabus, the weighting is breakdown is stated to be:
* quizzes are 25% of the overall grade
* homework is 35% of the overall grade
* exams are 40% of the overall grade.

In a surprise and controversial move, the grades have been made public to the class but the student information has been anonymized so that any identifying information individual for students has been stripped from the data.

> This is a peek into how grading might be carried out.  Grading may be applied differently depending on curriculum and standards.  Grading data for an entire class will generally not be made public for a variety of reasons such as privacy concerns.

With the final exam coming up, you are concerned with what your overall grade will be in the class.  You know that you can use Python to help analyze the data, so you download the class grades and try to assess where you stand.

### Data

Create a folder for this lab on your computer.  Download the [data.txt]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/data.txt" | absolute_url }}) file and copy it to your lab folder.

There are a total of 50 students in the class and the data in the file is organized as follows:
* columns 1-10 are the quiz grades
* columns 11-15 are the homework grades
* columns 16 is the midterm exam grade

## Data Analysis

There is no one sized fits all solution to data analysis and the process is data and domain driven.  Many fields have developed there own metrics, _i.e._ ways to quantify performance, and these metrics do not necessarily transfer from one field to another.  Throughout your undergraduate studies, you will be exposed to a number of different metrics and approaches to data analysis, and you should be careful when attempting to draw conclusions from an analysis as there are a variety of ways to abuse data and approaches which may result in invalid conclusions.

To perform data analysis, we typically need to examine a set of quantified data, perform some computations on the data, and visualize the data possibly using statistical tools or applying the problem to a different but related domain.  This process generally prescribes the following steps:
1. Read in data
2. Perform computations
3. Generate output

We will use ```numpy``` to perform bulk calculations on the data set and we will use ```matplotlib``` to generate output in the form of plots that we may interpret.  ```numpy``` also allows us to read in data using an simple set of functions, so we can rely on two modules to facilitate the whole of the data analysis process.

## ```numpy``` Basics

Just like last week, we need to use external modules to increase the capabilities available to us in Python.  While the ```turtle``` module allowed us to draw simple diagrams, the ```numpy``` module will allow us to perform bulk operations on large multidimensional arrays of data.  In order to use ```numpy```, we first need to import the module.  

> Generally, we import all modules that we will use in a Python program at the top of the file so that the modules are available all throughout the file.

At the beginning of your program include the following ```import``` statement:

```Python
import numpy as np
```

This statement both enables ```numpy``` to be used in the script and _**aliases**_ ```numpy``` using a shorthand notation ```np```.  We don't have to include the ```as np``` statement, but you will find that this is commonly done mostly for the sake of brevity.

### Reading Data from a File

The data for this scenario has been published in a file.  We wish to avoid hard-coding data directly into a program because data is transient.  Instead, we will typically design a generalized program that can read a file with a particular structure so that when the data changes, it is easy to run a new analysis by simply running the program again.

> Divorcing data from the code is especially important in compiled programs like those produced by Java or C/C++.

Reading data from a file can be quite complicated in many languages and even Python has very fundamental (and challenging to understand) read and write utilities; however, ```numpy``` provides some very simple tools for loading data from a file stored on the local hard-drive.  In order to load a structured data file into memory using ```numpy``` we can simply use the ```loadtxt``` function.

> Comprehensive documentation for ```loadtxt``` is found at [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html)

In order to load the grade data file, we use the following instruction:
```Python
grades = np.loadtxt("data.txt")
```

The above code loads the data stored in ```data.txt``` into a variable named ```grades```.  ```grades``` will be of the ```numpy.ndarray``` type which we will just call an array.

> ```loadtxt``` only works on structured numeric data and the default parameters assume that the fields are delimited by spaces.  ```loadtxt``` is not able to load any type of data file, and is explicitly provided to easily load data that is simple, consistently structured raw numeric data.  For more complex file structures, you will need to dive into the interfaces for [Python file I/O](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)

> ```numpy``` has a companion function to ```loadtxt``` called ```savetxt``` which allows you to easily save structured numeric data from ```numpy``` array into a data file which will be compatible with ```loadtxt```.  Comprehensive documentation for ```savetxt``` is found at [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html)

### ```numpy``` Arrays
An array is a structured set of n-dimensional data.  Most languages offer some means to store, structure, and access large amounts of data with like types in memory.  Sometimes this data has only one dimension like a simple list, sometimes this data has two dimensions which we might think of a table consisting of rows and columns, and sometimes this data has higher dimensionality like image data (3-dimensions) or other more sophisticated data representations.

Each element in the array has a combination of one or more _**indices**_ that define the element's storage location and enable direct access to that location.  In a one dimensional array, there is one index into the storage location.  To illustrate this, consider the following Python program:

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(100,200,10)

print(a)

print(a[0])
print(a[4])
print(a[9])
```
The above program produces the following output:
```
[100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190]
100
140
190
```
> The ```numpy.arange``` function generates an array where the first parameter defines the start value, the second parameter defines where to stop (not inclusive), and the third parameter defines the step.  In the above example, the sequence starts at 100, stops _before_ 200, and there is a 10 unit step between each element.  This is the same interface used by the ```range``` function we used with ```for``` loops last week.

The ```print(a)``` statement prints the contents of the array generated by the ```numpy.arange``` function and referenced by the variable ```a```.

The subsequent ```print``` statements access individual elements in the array based on their index within the array.  Python uses square brackets as array operators which instructs Python to access to _element at_ the indices inside the square brackets.

![1 Dimensional Array Indexing]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/array1d.png" | absolute_url }})

> Don't forget that most programming languages are developed by computer scientists for computer science based applications and it is quite common for these programming languages to live in a zero based indexing world.  The target audience for MatLab is not programmers but mathematicians, scientists, and engineers, so the MatLab developers agreed on a one based indexing convention instead of the zero based convention which  is one important difference between MatLab and ```numpy``` based code.

Let's generate a 2 dimensional array with the following structure and content:

![2 Dimensional Array Indexing]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/array1d.png" | absolute_url }})

```Python
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(100,400,10).reshape(3,10)

print(a)

print(a[0,0])
print(a[1,4])
print(a[2,9])
```
The above program produces the following output:

```
[[100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190]
 [200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290]
 [300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390]]
100
240
390
```
Note that in order to access an element in a two dimensional array, we must provide 2 indices.  We can think of the pair of indices as [row, column].  The output reflects that the first element we access is at indices row 0 and column 0, the second element we access is at row 1 and column 4, and the third element we access is at row 2 and column 9.

### Slicing

In the context of our grading problem, there is a set of mixed data within our single data set. and we would really prefer to perform very specific operations on particular subsets within our overall dataset.

For example, each row represents a single student and we might wish to extract data for one single student across the entire semester.  Alternatively, we might wish to extract all the grades for a single exam or all the quizzes and operate only on those subsets.

From a conventional programming perspective, we might consider using an iterative approach to locate the data and extract using a looping control structre; however,  ```numpy``` provided a much easier way which we call _**slicing**_.

### Slicing a Row
Suppose that we wish to extract a single row from our ```numpy.arange``` example.  For example, let's extract the entire second row from this data as illustrated below:
![Slicing a Row]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/array2d_hslice.png" | absolute_url }})

The ```numpy``` indexing operator using a simple syntax to allow a programmer to specify a range of values to be selected when indexing.  This syntax follows the same parameter arrangement as the standard Python ```range(start, stop, step)``` function but uses a colon to delimit between arguments.  Consider the following example using our ```numpy.arange``` example:

```Python
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(100,400,10).reshape(3,10)

print(a)
print()
print(a[1,:])

```
The above program produces the following output:
```
[[100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190]
 [200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290]
 [300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390]]

[200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290]
```
The first line of output is the familiar array that was generated using ```numpy.arange```; however, the second line of output is only the second row of the original array ```a```.  The slicing operation is performed on the last line of the example.

The slicing can be interpreted as "select row index 1 and select all columns".  The colon by itself ```:``` in the second index is interpreted as "all values in this field".  The colon is actually a delimiter that separates arguments for ```start:stop:step``` in the indexing context.  In the example, we omitted the ```start``` and ```stop``` and this is interpreted as the intent to select all.  

> But wait, there was only one colon in the example, what happened to the ```step``` field and the second colon?  ```step``` is an optional parameter.  If it is omitted, the step is assumed to be ```1```.

### Slicing a Column
Given that we can slice a row, it follows that we should be able to slice a column from the array as well.  For example, suppose we wish to slice the sixth column from our example:

![Slicing a Column]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/array2d_vslice.png" | absolute_url }})

Yes, we can slice along the column axis by manipulating the second index using the same syntax.  For example:

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(100,400,10).reshape(3,10)

print(a)
print()
print(a[:,5])
```
The above program produces the following output:
```
[[100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190]
 [200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290]
 [300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390]]

[150 250 350]
```

> Note that the output does not look like a column because it has been flattened out; however, it does contain the data values from that column.  This is because we sliced a one dimensional array out of a two dimensional array.  If we need to maintain it as a two dimensional array for say a matrix operation we can do so by manipulating the shape.


### Slicing a Sub-Array
We are not constrained to only slicing rows and columns.  We can slice out any subset from an array that we need.  For example, we might slice part of a row or part of a column or we might need to slice a sub-array from the overall array.  

![Slicing a Sub-Array]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/array2d_subslice.png" | absolute_url }})

Consider the case where we need to slice out a small subset of the original array such as a smaller array within the overall data set.
```python
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(100,400,10).reshape(3,10)

print(a)
print()
print(a[1:,4:7])
```
The above program produces the following output:
```
[[100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190]
 [200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290]
 [300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390]]

[[240 250 260]
 [340 350 360]]
```
> Note that the code specifies only one value for the row, but two rows were selected and the code specifies a range for the column but it did not include the last field.  

If an indexing argument is omitted when slicing it is assumed to be the default value.  When we used only a colon to indicate "all" in the whole row and column examples above, we omitted the ```start``` and ```stop``` arguments and so the slice was interpreted to begin and the smallest index ```0``` and end at the largest index.  In this example, we provided the ```start``` row index of ```1``` but omit the end index, so the slice begins at row index ```1``` and selects all remaining rows.

In the case where an end index is provided, the slice will stop at the index before the argument specified by the ```stop``` argument.  This can be confusing, but it does match the behavior of the ```range(start, stop, step)``` function.  The easiest way to understand it is if you take the difference between ```start``` and ```stop``` you will see the number of elements being returned in the slice.  In this example, we provided the ```start``` column index as ```4``` and the ```stop``` row index as ```7```, so the slice begins at column ```4``` and stops before column ```7``` excluding it but including column ```6```.  If we take the difference between ```7``` and ```4```, we get ```3``` which is the number of columns returned in the slice.

## ```matplotlib``` Basics
We will circle back and look at some more capabilities in ```numpy```, but first let's look at how we can visualize data using ```matplotlib```.  ```matplotlib``` contains a wide variety of plotting functions that we can use; however, we will focus on three basic plots today: line plots, scatter plots, and histograms.   

In order to gain access to the capabilities in ```matplotlib```, we need to import it just as we did with ```numpy``` and turtle.  Specifically, we will import the ```pyplot``` module from within the ```matplotlib``` library.  To import the plotting library, use the following import statement:

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Again, we are aliasing the module inside our own program as ```plt```, and again, you will find that this is so common that it is virtually a standard practice when using ```pyplot```.

### Line Plots
The basic interface for plotting uses the ```plot``` function from ```pyplot```, and the documentation for the ```plot``` function can be found on the [```matplotlib``` website](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html).

Let's start with plotting from our ```numpy.arange``` based example:
```Python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

a = np.arange(100,400,10).reshape(3,10)

print(a)
print()

idx = np.arange(0,a.shape[1])
print(idx)

print(a[1,:])

plt.plot(idx,a[1,:])

plt.savefig("line.png")
```
The following plot is generated by the above code:
![arange Example No Labels ]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/arange_line_nolabels.png" | absolute_url }})

While we have generated a plot, it does not really provide much context for us to understand the data much less interpret it.  We can give a lot more meaningful context by providing a title and labels on the axes.  We can provide this information with the additions in the following code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

a = np.arange(100,400,10).reshape(3,10)

print(a)
print()

idx = np.arange(0,a.shape[1])
print(idx)

print(a[1,:])

plt.plot(idx,a[1,:])
plt.title("arange Example -- row 2")
plt.xlabel("idx")
plt.ylabel("Row Values")

plt.savefig("line.png")
```
The above code produces the following plot:
![arange Example with Labels ]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/arange_line.png" | absolute_url }})
We can see that the labels give us more context to work with and the line plot does reflect the data that we requested to be plotted.  Let's take a closer look at this part:
```Python
idx = np.arange(0,a.shape[1])

plt.plot(idx,a[1,:])
```

The ```plot``` function takes a arrays containing the set of x and y values as parameters.  The first argument ```idx``` is the set of x values and the second argument is a slice of the array ```a```.  These two arrays must have the same number of elements in them.  The following line generates an array of integers from 0 to the number of columns in ```a``` and stores it in the variable ```idx```:
```python
idx = np.arange(0,a.shape[1])
```

We can call ```plot``` multiple times with different sets of values to plot multiple lines.  For example, the following program plots each row in the table constructed using ```arange```:
```Python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

a = np.arange(100,400,10).reshape(3,10)

print(a)
print()

idx = np.arange(0,a.shape[1])

plt.plot(idx,a[0,:])
plt.plot(idx,a[1,:])
plt.plot(idx,a[2,:])

plt.title("arange Example -- row 2")
plt.xlabel("idx")
plt.ylabel("Row Values")

plt.savefig("line.png")
```
The above code produces the following plot:
![arange multiline example ]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/arange_multiline.png" | absolute_url }})

### Scatter Plots
In addition to line plots, we may wish to use a scatter plot to visualize data.  A line plot is probably more useful for identifying trends and may not be relevant for some types of data such as the visualization of individual samples.  The interface for generating a scatter plot is basically the same as a line plot except we use the ```scatter``` function.  For example, the following code generates a scatter plot the echoes the multiline plot from the previous example:

```Python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

a = np.arange(100,400,10).reshape(3,10)

print(a)
print()

idx = np.arange(0,a.shape[1])

plt.scatter(idx,a[0,:])
plt.scatter(idx,a[1,:])
plt.scatter(idx,a[2,:])

plt.title("arange Scatter Example")
plt.xlabel("idx")
plt.ylabel("Row Values")

plt.savefig("scatter.png")
```
The above code produces the following plot:
![arange multiline example ]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/arange_multiline.png" | absolute_url }})

### Histograms
A histogram allows us to see how closely grouped a population is.  In the case of a histogram, we can simply provide the set of samples that we would like the population distribution and the number of bins in which to group similar samples.  For example, this example uses the ```arange``` sample data:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

a = np.arange(100,400,10).reshape(3,10)

print(a)
print()

plt.hist(a.reshape(a.shape[0]*a.shape[1]), bins = 100)

plt.title("arange Histogram Example")
plt.xlabel("Row Values")
plt.ylabel("# of Samples")

plt.savefig("hist.png")
```
The above code produces the following plot:
![arange histogram example ]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/arange_hist.png" | absolute_url }})

If we interpret the above histogram, we see that all samples are uniformly distributed.  This is not exactly the best example for histogram analysis.  We might use a different function to generate our sample data.  For example:

```Python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mu = 0
sigma = 1
a = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)

plt.hist(a, bins = 50)

plt.title("arange Histogram Example")
plt.xlabel("Row Values")
plt.ylabel("# of Samples")

plt.savefig("hist.png")
```
The above code produces the following plot:

![normal histogram example ]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab2/normal_hist.png" | absolute_url }})

Hopefully you recognize this as the "normal" or Gaussian distribution otherwise known as a bell curve.

## Bulk ```numpy``` Operations

Two of the benefits offered by ```numpy``` is the ability to perform mathematical operations between two arrays or to perform statistical operations on an array.  For example, we can add two arrays togehter using the mathematical ```+``` operator assuming that the arrays are the same size.  Note that this is element-wise addition and not a more sophisticated form of matrix addition which may require usage of a matrix function.  We can also perform a bulk operation like computing the mean of a set of elements by using the ```mean()``` function.

### Transposing a numpy array
Transpose is a term that is borrowed from linear algebra which means to flip a matrix across the diagonal.  For more information on the transpose operation, look at the [Transpose Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose).  The practical application of transpose is to convert rows to columns and columns to rows without otherwise changing the structure or contents of an array.  In order to carry out an operation, we may need to change an array from row major format to column major format meaning we may need to swap rows to columns and vice versa.

```Python
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(10)        # arange produces a 1 dimensional array
a = a.reshape((2,5))     # reshape a into a 2 dimensional array
b = a.transpose()        # transpose a into a 5x2 array
print(b)
```
The output from the above is as follows:
```
[[0 5]
 [1 6]
 [2 7]
 [3 8]
 [4 9]]
```
On the surface, it may appear that we could achieve the same result by reshaping the array; however, this is not often the case.  For example, the following code attempts to reshape the array to produce the same structure as the above code:
```Python
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(10)        # arange produces a 1 dimensional array
a = a.reshape((2,5))     # reshape a into a 2 dimensional array
b = a.reshape((5,2))     # attempt to reshape into a 5x2 array
print(b)
```
The above code produces the following output:
```
[[0 1]
 [2 3]
 [4 5]
 [6 7]
 [8 9]]
```
Note how the second output differs from the first.  Make sure that you are using the correct method for your intent.

Transpose is often the better choice instead of reshape as we do not need to explicitly know the dimensions of the array to use ```transpose``` while we do when we use ```reshape```.

The ```T``` property of an ```ndarray``` already holds the transpose and produces the same result as calling the ```transpose()``` function.
```Python
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(10)        # arange produces a 1 dimensional array
a = a.reshape((2,5))     # reshape a into a 2 dimensional array
b = a.T                  # transpose a into a 5x2 array
print(b)
```

### Find the minimum or maximum value in a ```numpy``` array
We can ask a ```numpy``` array to return its minimum and maximum values by calling the ```min``` and ```max``` methods respectively.

For example, the following code generates a 3x3 array within the range [0,8] and then copies the minimum value and the maximum value into ```Amin``` and ```Amax```:

```python
import numpy as np
A = np.arange(9)
A = A.reshape((3,3))
Amin, Amax = A.min(), A.max()
print(Amin, Amax)
```
The above code produces the following output:
```
0 8
```
You should see that the first value printed in the output reflects the minimum value in the array and the second value in the output reflects the maximum value in the array.

> This line ```Amin, Amax = A.min(), A.max()``` should draw your attention.  Yes, you can have multiple variables to the left of the assignment operator.  This operation is effectively assigning both ```Amin``` and ```Amax``` simultaneously.  This capability is very unique and there are few languages that support the ability to assign multiple variables to different values in one step.

### Find the mean value in a ```numpy``` array
We can ask a ```numpy``` array to return the mean (average) of all values by calling the ```mean``` method.

For example, the following code generates a 3x3 array within the range [0,8] and then asks the array for the mean of all values in the array:
```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.arange(9)
A = A.reshape((3,3))
print(A)
print(A.mean())
```
The above code produces the following output:
```
[[0 1 2]
 [3 4 5]
 [6 7 8]]
4.0
```
The value ```4.0``` is the average of all values in the array.

Because a slice is itself an array, we can slice the array and ask the slice for its own mean:
```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.arange(9)
A = A.reshape((3,3))
print(A)
print(A[:,2].mean())
```
The above code produces the following output:
```
[[0 1 2]
 [3 4 5]
 [6 7 8]]
5.0
```
In the above example, we sliced the last column from ```A``` and then computed the mean for that column.  You should see that ```5.0``` is the average of all values in the last column.

## Other ```numpy``` Mathematical Functions
There a broad variety of [mathematical](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.math.html), [linear algebra](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.linalg.html), and [randomization](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html) functions in ```numpy```.  Some of these functions are also implemented in the Python ```math``` module or in the core of Python; however, the ```numpy``` based functions are explicitly designed to operate on ```ndarray```'s very efficiently.  In many cases, we can use these functions on an entire ```ndarray``` in a single operation without the need to iterate.

We cannot cover all functions in ```numpy```, so you should consult the [```numpy``` mathematical function reference page](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.math.html) before attempting to use a more basic technique that requires you to iterate over an ```ndarray```.  The following section details using some typically used functions which should help you generally understand how you can use the ```numpy``` mathematical functions without iteration.

Many of these functions are intended to work on vectors only.  A one dimensional array is also known as a _**vector**_.

### Computing the Median using [```numpy.median```](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.median.html)

We may need to find the middle (median) value in a row or column in an array.  In order to do this, we can use the ```median``` function.  The median function has the following declaration:
```Python
numpy.median(a, axis=None, out=None, overwrite_input=False, keepdims=False)
```
We can use median without any of the optional parameters if we pass a row or column as the argument ```a```.  For example, the following code generates a simple matrix and uses slicing to retrieve the median of the first row and the first column:

```python
import numpy as np
A = np.arange(9)
A = A.reshape((3,3))
print(A)
print(np.median(A[0,:]))   # get the median of the first row
print(np.median(A[:,0]))   # get the median of the first column
```
The above code produces the following output:
```
[[0 1 2]
 [3 4 5]
 [6 7 8]]
1.0
3.0
```

### Computing the standard deviation using [```numpy.std```](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.std.html)

For statistical analysis, we may need to find the standard deviation for a set of data.  ```numpy``` provides the ```std``` function to compute the standard deviation on an array.  The declaration for ```std``` is as follows:

```Python
numpy.std(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, ddof=0, keepdims=<no value>)
```
The ```std``` function computes the standard deviation on the distribution of values in the array.  In many cases, we wish to compute the standard deviation for a row or column.  We can slice the array (rows or columns) and pass the slice to the ```std``` function so that we can compute the standard deviation on a subset of the original array.  For example, the following computes the standard deviation for the first column in the array:
```python
import numpy as np
A = np.arange(100)
A = A.reshape((10,10))
print(np.std(A[0,:]))
```
The above code produces the following output:
```
2.8722813232690143
```

### Computing a Difference using [```numpy.diff```](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.diff.html)

We may need to compute the change between two samples.  We could accomplish this by iterating over an ```ndarray``` and computing the difference between each neighboring record; however, ```numpy``` provides a built in function that performs this calculation in one statement and is highly flexible, _i.e._ ```diff```.  For example, if we wish to compute the difference along the first column of an ```ndarray```, we can use the following approach:

```python
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1,2,4])
delta = np.diff(a)
print(delta)
```
The above code produces the following output:
```
[1 2]
```
The output represents the difference between each neighbor in the ```ndarray``` ```a```.  Let's double check:

* For any set of ```n``` elements, the total count of differences between neighbors should be ```n-1```.  Original array ```a``` consists of 3 elements and the ```delta``` difference array consists of 2 elements, so this is consistent.
* The difference between the first and second element is ```2-1``` which is represented as ```1``` in ```delta```, and the difference between the second and third element is ```4-2``` which is represented as ```2``` in ```delta```, so this is also consistent.

The ```diff``` function is not limited to one dimensional ```ndarray```s.  For example, the following code computes the difference between neighboring cells for each row:
```Python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]])
print(a)
delta = np.diff(a)
print(delta)
```
The above code produces the following output:
```
a= [[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]
delta= [[1]
 [1]
 [1]]
```
In the above output, the result is consistent because we expect to have three rows in ```delta``` because we computed the difference across rows, we expect to have one value in ```delta``` for each row because each row of ```a``` has two values,  and the values in ```delta``` should be ```1``` because the neighboring values in ```a``` are sequential.

However, we might instead need to compute the difference between each neighboring cells for each column.  We can do this by explicitly setting the axis argument for ```diff```.  For example:
```Python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]])
print(a)
delta = np.diff(a,axis=0)
print(delta)
```
The above code produces the following output:
```
a= [[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]
delta= [[2 2]
 [2 2]]
```

In the above output, the result is consistent because we expect to have two rows in ```delta``` because we computed the difference between rows, we expect to have two values in ```delta``` for each row because each row of ```a``` has two values,  and the values in ```delta``` should be ```2``` because the neighboring values from row-to-row in ```a``` have a difference of ```2```.

We can also use slicing to compute the difference within some subset of the original data.  For example, the following code computes the difference in the first column by using a slice:
```Python
import numpy as np
a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]])
print("a=",a)
delta = np.diff(a[:,0])
print("delta=",delta)
```
 The above code produces the following output:
```
 a= [[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]
delta= [2 2]
```

## Exercises

1. Which student is in significant trouble and what grade might they need to score on the final exam to not fail (>=60 overall) the class?
2. Which student has the highest average and what grade might they need to receive an A+ (>=95 overall) for the class?
3. For what assignments did students generally underperform?
