# Lab 7 - Networking

## Introduction:

Communication is the process of exchange of information between 2 or more entities.  Data communication is the process of transmission of data between 2 or more computers.  The connection between those computers is established by using either wired media such as cables or wireless media such as Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi).  The best example of a computer network is the Internet.

In computer networks, data is transmitted from one computer to another in form of packets. Everything we do on the web, like requesting a website from the internet, sending an email or a text message involves packets.  

We can think of a packet as an envelope that contains a message.  The envelope has address information and contains message data.  The packet is routed through a network path and is delivered to the destination specified by the address on the envelope.

## Basic Components of a Computer Network:
1. _**Servers**_: Servers provide services to other computers.  They may share files, data, programs, and computational resources.  There are multiple types of servers and they can serve different functions. For Example- File Servers, Mail Servers, Database Servers, Web Servers etc.

2. _**Clients**_: Clients resources provided by networked systems, such as a server.  Clients can be thought of as ‘customers’ and their requests are fulfilled by servers.

### Client-Server Model:
The client-server model partitions the workload of a distributed application system between a service provider, a server, and a service requester, a client.  Clients and servers interact with each other through some limited abstract interface.  One such interface is via a network however they can also be found on the same system.  To communicate over a network, client and server programs must establish a connection.

We can assume a radio station tower and a radio connecting as an example of the client-server system. A radio station is always broadcasting content, hence being available and ready to connect to anything. Content can be termed as a service in this scenario. Hence the radio station becomes a server providing a service to anyone who wishes to use the service. A radio can be assumed as a client since it is a system that can request a service from the radio station tower by tuning in to a particular frequency that the radio station tower is broadcasting on.

A radio (client) requests from the radio station tower (server) to deliver content (service) on an as-need basis is a simple one-way communication between a client and a server.

### Establishing a connection:
Three basic terms that we need to know are:
1. _**IP Address**_: It is a numerical label that is assigned to each computer connected to a network. It also helps us identify that computer (host), provides the location of that host and hence, the capability to establish a path to that host.
2. _**Port Number**_: A port is a numeric assigned to a communication endpoint. Both wired and wireless are terminated at the ports of hardware devices. A Port Number is always used with an IP address of the host and protocol type of the communication. It is a 16-bit unsigned number, thus ranging from 0 to 65535.
3. _**Network Socket**_: In a nutshell, the combination of an IP Address and a port is technically called as an endpoint, but also called as a socket.

## Example 1 : A Radio-like Client-Server

### Server code example
```python
import socket
import time
host='127.0.0.1'
port=1234
message=["There's.","No","Place","Like","127.0.0.1!"]
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((host,port))
print("Server Socket was created and bound!")
s.listen(1)
```

In the given code, we begin by initializing 2 libraries, socket and time. Socket is a library that allows to create a socket and time is the library that helps us manipulate time.

We are initiating 3 variables. First is host, which holds the IP address of the machine. The second one is port here we are storing the port number (communication endpoint) of the machine. In this scenario, since we only want to connect a server and a client that are active on the same computer, we are using the IP Address (host) as (127.0.0.1).  The 127.0.0.1 IP Address results in a loopback to our own machine and is called as the local host. We can use any port that we want ranging from 0 to 65535, but we are using 1234 as a port. Port 80 is the default port for http. The third variable is a list named ‘messages’ which contains five string values.

We create an instance of a socket and pass 2 arguments. The first argument is the ```AF_INET``` which represents the IPv4 family addresses. The second argument is the ```SOCK_STREAM``` which represents connection-oriented TCP protocol. After the socket ```s``` is initialized, we bind the socket with the address (consisting of host address and port address). And then we decide to turn the ```s.listen``` to ```1```. What this does is that it switches the socket into a listening mode that help server to listen to connection requests from other clients.

### Client code example
```python
import socket
host='127.0.0.1'
port=1234
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
print("Client Socket Successfully created!")
s.connect((host,port))
```

In the given code, we begin by initializing socket library that allows to create a socket. We don’t need the time library because we use the time library to introduce a delay between messages and we are not sending anything from the client to the server.

We are initiating 2 variables. First is host, which holds the IP address of the machine that we will connect to, which is the server. The second one is port here we are storing the port number (communication endpoint) of the machine as ```1234```.  The first argument being ```AF_INET``` and the second argument ```SOCK_STREAM```. If the socket gets created successfully, the program prints a confirmation.

We use ```connect``` on the client side with the socket and pass the host and the port as the arguments. The connect function sends a request of connection to the host and the port number that is provided as the arguments. In case of a TCP socket, it attempts to establish a TCP connection.

The important thing to remember is that both server and client have their own sockets. A distinction should be made between both the sockets. When the client creates a socket, it creates it for itself. And it sends the connection request with its own socket information. But when the server creates the socket for itself, it binds it with the address so that it could set it into listening mode. As soon as the client’s connection request hits the server, server receives the client information by activating the listening mode
A TCP connection is defined by two endpoints. Or two sockets.

### Communication Models:
1. One-way Communication: In this type of communication, the information is transferred in a single direction only. Information is sent from the sender to the receiver. But the receiver does not get a chance to reply back.
An example of one-way communication can be a radio tuned in to a radio station where the radio station broadcast data to the radio, but the radio cannot reply back to the radio station. Drawing contrast of this scenario with the client-server model, the radio (client) tunes into the service provided by the radio station (server) which establishes a connection between client and server and provides the radio broadcast (service).

2. Two-way Communication: A two-way communication lifts the limitation and allows both the parties involved to interact with each other. Information is sent bi-directionally and both get a chance to send and receive data.
An example of a two-way communication can be a telephone conversation between 2 people. Both Telephone 1 and Telephone 2 are capable of sending and receiving data (sound). Which means both are communicating in a two-way manner.
At the beginning of the scenario, a user (Telephone 2) tries to establish a connection with another person by dialing their phone number (Telephone 1). A similarity can be drawn between the IP Address being the area code of the 10 digit number and the port number being the actual 7 digit number after the area code. After the connection is established, both can send and receive sound on their end.

3. Conferencing: This is the formal term to describe a computer mediated communication. This type of communication assures that all the participants are communicating. All the clients are connected to a server which passes the messages between the clients. Telephony can be an example of conferencing if more then 2 telephones are connected. A video chat like FaceTime and Skype are also an example of conferencing where more than 2 people (clients) are communicating through a server which mediates the messages between the
clients. We can also see online chat as an example of conferencing where there are multiple people sending strings of messages to each other.
This type of communication may have two or more participants (clients) that are connected to each other through a central hub that acts as a server. Every client has the capability to send and receive sound and video from the other clients.

### Server
```python
import socket
import time
host='127.0.0.1'
port=1234
message=["There's.","No","Place","Like","127.0.0.1!"]
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((host,port))
print("Server Socket was created and bound!")
s.listen(1)
conn, addr=s.accept()
print("Conn:",conn,"Address:",addr)
while True:
    for i in message:
    conn.send(i.encode('utf-8'))
    time.sleep(1)
```

### Client
```python
import socket
host='127.0.0.1'
port=1234
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
print("Client Socket Successfully created!")
s.connect((host,port))
while True:
    data=s.recv(1024)
    if not data:
        break
    print("Received:",data.decode('utf-8'))
```
## Two-way Client-Server, aka Telephony

![two-way]({{ "/gwu/fa19/cs1010/assets/lab7/twoway.png" | absolute_url }})

### Server
```python
import socket
host='127.0.0.1'
port=1234
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((host,port))
print("Server Socket was created and bound!")
s.listen(1)
conn, addr=s.accept() print("Conn:",conn,"Address:",addr)
while True:
    print(">> ")
    data=input()
    conn.send(data.encode('utf-8'))
    data=conn.recv(1024)
    print("Client:",data.decode('utf-8'))
```
### Client
```python
import socket
host='127.0.0.1'
port=1234
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM) print("Client Socket Successfully created!")
s.connect((host,port))
while True:
    data=s.recv(1024)
    print("Server:",data.decode('utf-8'))
    print(">> ")
    data=input()
    s.send(data.encode('utf-8'))
```

Given the examples we have so far covered, how can we produce a client-server system to model multi-user conferencing?
