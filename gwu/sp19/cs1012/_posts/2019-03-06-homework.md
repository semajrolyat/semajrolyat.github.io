## Homework 6

### Due Date
**This homework is due March 20, 2019 before class.**

## Introduction
You **MUST** include comments in your code.  If your code contains no comments, it is incomplete and will not receive credit.  Comments are as important to your code as the code itself.

You must include a comment in the header portion of the file that summarizes what the program does.  You must include comments preceding any functions that you declare that describe each of the function's inputs, what the function does, and what the function returns (if it returns a value).  You must include comments inline with code to describe the steps in natural language.

## Drawing a Filled Shape

So far, we have used a number of functions from the ```turtle``` module: ```forward```, ```backward```, ```left```, ```right```, ```penup```, ```pendown```, ```xcor```, ```ycor```, and ```setposition```.  However, With this limited set of functions, we have been constrained to drawing with only black lines and only with unfilled shapes.  ```turtle``` has the ability to draw lines with color and to fill enclosed areas with color by using the ```color``` function to specify a line color and the ```begin_fill``` and ```end_fill``` functions to instruct the turtle to fill an area.

### ```turtle``` ```color```
According to the [Python documentation for turtle color ](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle#turtle.color), the ```color``` function can be used to set or retrieve the current drawing color for the turtle.  The ```color``` function takes no parameters when retrieving the current color and can take a variety of parameters when setting the color.  For our purposes, we will focus on setting the color using the simplest interface with ```color``` which involves the use of one parameter which is a string that describes the desired color.  The definition for this color function is as follows:

```python
def color(colorstring):
```
The ```colorstring``` parameter can be a color name such as ```"red"```, ```"green"```, ```blue```, etc.  For example, if we wish the turtle to draw using a red pen, we would call ```color``` and specify ```"red"``` before calling any other drawing functions:

```python
from turtle import *
color("red")
forward(100)
done()
```

The above code would draw a red line ```100``` units long.

### Filling an Area
Similar to the ```penup``` and ```pendown``` functions, the ```begin_fill``` and ```end_fill``` functions allow us to specify when to mark the beginning and end of a fill operation.  ```begin_fill``` marks the beginning point where the fill area should be computed from and ```end_fill``` marks the end point.  The filled area is not drawn until ```end_fill``` is encountered.  Neither of these functions take parameters.

The following code illustrates drawing a filled circle using ```begin_fill``` and ```end_fill```:

```python
from turtle import *
begin_fill()
circle(100)
end_fill()
done()
```

For more information, refer to the [Python documentation for turtle fill](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle#turtle.begin_fill)

## Checkerboard

Create a file named ```homework06.py```.

For this homework, you will draw a checkerboard that is centered in the middle of the drawing area.  Each alternating tile of the checkerboard must be filled and you must use a color other than black.  Your program should produce output that resembles the following image:

![Checkerboard]({{ "/gwu/sp19/cs1012/assets/homework06/homework06.png" | absolute_url }})

Your program **must** include one function for drawing the outline of a square and a separate function for drawing a filled square.  If you are clever, the function for drawing a filled square will call the function for drawing the outline of a square.  If you are really clever you can use generalized polygon code from the exercises to support drawing squares.

### Approach

Note that this is an iterative problem and involves two loops: one loop that draw all the cells in a row and one that draws each row.  You might use a number of functions to encapsulate each of these concepts so that you can break the problem down into its constituent problems, solve each one, and then work back to a complete solution.  

For example, this whole problem is based on drawing at least one square.  Start by developing the code to outline one square and test it.  

Once you have proven that you can draw the outline of one square, develop the code to fill one square and test it.  Remember that we do not want to have the same code in more than one location, so try to implement your fill function using the function you already developed to outline a square.  

Once you have proven that you can draw both types of square, tackle drawing a single row of alternating squares and before moving on prove that this code is able to start with either a filled or unfilled square.  Do not overthink this too much as it is a simple boolean problem and can be solved using really simple boolean operations.  Try to imagine an outlined square as 'fill off' and a filled square as 'fill on' and the alternating action is a simple switch between 'fill on' and 'fill off'.

Once you have solved all of the preceding problems, drawing multiple rows to create the checkerboard simply involves reusing the row drawing code.  The difficult part of this problem will probably be with resetting the location of the pen to draw a subsequent row; however, this should be made easier if you recall using ```setposition``` to move the turtle to location.

### Submission

Create a zip file containing ```homework06.py``` and submit the zip file before class Wednesday following Spring Break (March 20, 2019)
