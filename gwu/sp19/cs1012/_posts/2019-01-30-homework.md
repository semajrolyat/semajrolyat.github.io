## Homework 2

### Due Date
**This homework is due February 6, 2019 before class.**

### Homework 2 - Draw a Snowman
Write a python script named ```homework02.py```.

In this homework, write a script that draws a snowman.  Your snowman must have three progressively smaller circles stacked on top of one another to form the overall body, the snowman must wear a top hat, and the snowman must have features such as three buttons in its middle section as well as eyes and a nose in its head.  For example:

![Homework 2 Snowman]({{ "/gwu/sp19/cs1012/assets/homework02/snowmanlarge.png" | absolute_url }})

The primary restriction is that all of the movements of the turtle whether drawing a shape or repositioning must depend on a single primary variable.  You may use multiple variables; however, all secondary variables must derive there values from a calculation that uses the primary variable.  The practical benefit of computing the dimensions of the snowman from one primary variable means that we can draw other snowmen with the same dimensions relative to our model snowman while changing the overall scale of each of the additional snowmen.  For example, the following image uses the exact same logic to draw the snowman at 75% scale relative to the above image:  

![Homework 2 Smaller Snowman]({{ "/gwu/sp19/cs1012/assets/homework02/snowmansmall.png" | absolute_url }})

In the examples, all of the distances are computed with respect to a variable ```radius``` which controls the size of the middle section of the snowman.  You can choose a different basis; however, all movement commands, _e.g._ ```forward```, ```backward```, ```circle```, etc., must be computed from your variable.  For example:

```python
radius = 30
#middle
circle(radius)
#bottom
right(90)
penup()
forward(radius*3)
# etc.
```

Note that rotations are not subject to scaling, so ```right``` and ```left``` commands do not need to be based on the variable.  

You are welcome to add any additional artistic elements that you would like; however, the variable that controls the drawing must appear before any other turtle commands, _i.e._ after the standard header code but before any commands to move the turtle.

### Submission

Create a zip file containing ```homework02.py``` named ```homework02.zip``` and submit the zip file before class next Wednesday (February 6, 2019)
