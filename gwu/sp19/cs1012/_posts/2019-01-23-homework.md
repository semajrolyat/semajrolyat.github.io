## Homework 1 - Draw a House
This homework is due January 30, 2019 before class.

Write a python script named ```homework01.py``` that draws a house.  

You may draw the house with whatever dimensions you choose; however, it must have the following general characteristics:  a pitched roof, a centered door and a window on either side of the door.  The turtle can end up anywhere you choose.  For example, your house should generally look like the following:

![Homework 1 House]({{ "/gwu/sp19/cs1012/assets/homework01/house.png" | absolute_url }})

Take a screenshot of your house and save it as ```homework01.png```.  Create a zip file containing both ```homework01.py``` and ```homework01.py``` and submit the zip file before class next Wednesday (January 30, 2019)
