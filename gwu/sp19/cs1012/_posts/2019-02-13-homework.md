## Homework 4

### Due Date
**This homework is due February 20, 2019 before class.**

## Introduction
We have seen that in drawing the square, we used the same operations multiple times:

```python
from turtle import *
# Length of a side
x = 100

# Draw a square with sides equal to x units
forward(x)
left(90)
forward(x)
left(90)
forward(x)
left(90)
forward(x)

done()
```

Drawing the square is a process of repeatedly drawing an edge and then turning to prepare to draw the next edge.  We can reduce the code needed to draw a square by using a ```for``` loop along with the ```range``` function:
```python
from turtle import *
length = 100
# Draw a square with edges of length
for i in range(4):
    forward(length)
    left(90)

done()
```
A square is a regular polygon --- it is both equilateral and equiangular --- and drawing any regular polygon involves the same basic procedure.

The values used for the angles are determined by the fact that a square is by definition fully enclosed and has four sides of equal length (equilateral).  From this definition, we know a square must also have four angles, _i.e._ an angle between each pair of adjacent edges, of equal degree (equiangular).

The degree of the internal angle for a regular polygon is defined by the following formula:

>```internal angle = 180(1-2/n)``` where ```n``` is the number of sides.

Therefore, the internal angle for a square is computed as:

>```internal angle = 90 (degrees per angle) = 180(1/2) = 180(1-2/4)```

However, consider that in order to turn the turtle with the correct angle, the turtle **does not** turn along the internal angle but turns instead along the external angle.  The following image illustrates how the turtle must turn:

![Turtle turn angle in a regular polygon]({{ "/gwu/sp19/cs1012/assets/homework04/polygon-angle.png" | absolute_url }})

This implies that to compute the external angle along which the turtle must turn, we change the internal angle formula to the following:

 >```external angle = 180 - 180(1-2/n)```

 which simplifies to:

 >```external angle = 360/n```

We can generalize the code for drawing a square a step further by computing the turn angle for the turtle, _i.e._ the external angle, using above formula:
```python
from turtle import *

length = 100
angle = 360 / 4
# Draw a square with edges of length
for i in range(4):
    forward(length)
    left(angle)
done()
```

### Homework 4 - Draw a "Honeycomb"
Write a python script named ```homework04.py```.

In this homework, you will write a script that draws a honeycomb pattern using the ```turtle```.  A honeycomb pattern appears when many hexagons are fit together along the walls of the hexagon.  A hexagon is a regular polygon, so we can use the information in the introduction to draw one or more hexagons.

You must use one or more ```for``` loops to draw your honeycomb.  Your drawing code for the hexagon must not appear more than once within the body of the program.  You may need to have some additional movement code to reposition the turtle; however, the actual code that draws the hexagon must appear in one place inside the looping control structure(s) that you use to repeatedly draw.



### Submission
