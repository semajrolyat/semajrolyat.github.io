## Homework 4

### Due Date
**This homework is due February 20, 2019 before class.**

## Introduction
We have seen that in drawing the square, we used the same operations multiple times:

```python
from turtle import *
# Length of a side
x = 100

# Draw a square with sides equal to x units
forward(x)
left(90)
forward(x)
left(90)
forward(x)
left(90)
forward(x)

done()
```

Drawing the square is a process of repeatedly drawing an edge and then turning to prepare to draw the next edge.  We can reduce the code needed to draw a square by using a ```for``` loop along with the ```range``` function:
```python
from turtle import *
length = 100
# Draw a square with edges of length
for i in range(4):
    forward(length)
    left(90)

done()
```
A square is a regular polygon --- it is both equilateral and equiangular --- and drawing any regular polygon involves the same basic procedure.

The values used for the angles are determined by the fact that a square is by definition fully enclosed and has four sides of equal length (equilateral).  From this definition, we know a square must also have four angles, _i.e._ an angle between each pair of adjacent edges, of equal degree (equiangular).

The degree of the internal angle for a regular polygon is defined by the following formula:

>```internal angle = 180(1-2/n)``` where ```n``` is the number of sides.

Therefore, the internal angle for a square is computed as:

>```internal angle = 90 (degrees per angle) = 180(1/2) = 180(1-2/4)```

However, consider that in order to turn the turtle with the correct angle, the turtle **does not** turn along the internal angle but turns instead along the external angle.  The following image illustrates how the turtle must turn:

![Turtle turn angle in a regular polygon]({{ "/gwu/sp19/cs1012/assets/homework04/polygon-angle.png" | absolute_url }})

This implies that to compute the external angle along which the turtle must turn, we change the internal angle formula to the following:

 >```external angle = 180 - 180(1-2/n)```

 which simplifies to:

 >```external angle = 360/n```

We can generalize the code for drawing a square a step further by computing the turn angle for the turtle, _i.e._ the external angle, using above formula:
```python
from turtle import *

length = 100
angle = 360 / 4
# Draw a square with edges of length
for i in range(4):
    forward(length)
    left(angle)
done()
```

### Homework 4 - Draw a "Honeycomb"
Write a python script named ```homework04.py```.

In this homework, you will write a script that draws a honeycomb pattern using the ```turtle```.  A honeycomb pattern appears when many hexagons are fit together along the walls of the hexagon.  For example, the following image illustrates the honeycomb pattern:

![Honeycomb]({{ "/gwu/sp19/cs1012/assets/homework04/honeycomb.png" | absolute_url }})

A hexagon is a regular polygon, so we can use the information in the introduction to draw one or more hexagons.  We will also need to reposition the turtle between drawing a hexagon.  The repetitive process for drawing a set of fit together hexagons is therefore, lower the pen, draw a hexagon, raise the pen, reposition the turtle.

The output of your program must consist of at least three hexagons per row and it must draw at least four rows of adjacent hexagons.  You do not need to worry about the cascading alignment in the previous image and you can instead stair-step in the same direction.  For example, the following image illustrates the minimum requirements for your program:

![Honeycomb Requirements]({{ "/gwu/sp19/cs1012/assets/homework04/requirements.png" | absolute_url }})

You must use one or more ```for``` loops to draw your honeycomb.  Most likely, you will have three loops to satisfy the requirements: one for "rows", one for "columns", and an inner-most one to draw the hexagon.  _**Your drawing code for the hexagon must not appear more than once within the body of the program**_.  You may need to have additional movement code to reposition the turtle; however, the actual code that draws the hexagon must appear in one place inside the looping control structure(s) that you use to repeatedly draw.  Basically, with the pen up, you can move the turtle freely; however, you must contain the hexagon drawing code in one loop with the pen down and this drawing code can only appear once in the code.

As illustrated above, your program must draw at least four "rows" with three hexagons in a row and each row must be positioned correctly so that a honeycomb pattern emerges.  

For reference, the above images assumed the length of the hexagon side to be 15 units.

### Notes
We have only used a few commands out of the turtle library.  There are three additional commands that you may add to your repertoire for this program: ```setposition(x,y)```, ```xcor()```, and ```ycor```.  You do not have to use the commands and they are not necessary to solve complete this assignment; however, they can be very useful.  You may not use any other commands from turtle that we have not discussed.

```setposition(x,y)``` allows you to move a turtle immediately to a new position on the canvas.  This command is useful for initial placement of the turtle whenever you are about to start a new row.

```xcor()``` allows you to ask the canvas for the current x-coordinate of the turtle and is useful for storing where the turtle was when it began the previous row.   

```ycor()``` likewise allows you to ask the canvas for the current y-coordinate of the turtle and is useful for storing where the turtle was when it began the previous row.   

For example, when I start drawing, I raise the pen and use ```setposition``` to move to a position up and to the left of the origin:
```python
x = -64
y = 31

penup()
setposition(x,y)
```

When I start a new row, I use ```setposition``` using the last ```x``` and ```y``` to return to the start of the previous row.  I can then walk to the beginning of the new row and store this new point using the following code:
```python
x = xcor()
y = ycor()
```
Later when I start a new row, I use the most recent ```x``` and ```y``` (obtained through the above code) to get back to the last place I started and I can then walk to the beginning of the next new row using the exact same code as before.
