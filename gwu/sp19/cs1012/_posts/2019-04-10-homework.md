## Homework 9

### Due Date
**This homework is due April 17, 2019 before class.**

## Introduction
You **MUST** include comments in your code.  If your code contains no comments, it is incomplete and will not receive credit.  Comments are as important to your code as the code itself.

You must include a comment in the header portion of the file that summarizes what the program does.  You must include comments preceding any functions that you declare that describe each of the function's inputs, what the function does, and what the function returns (if it returns a value).  You must include comments inline with code to describe the steps in natural language.

## Normal Distribution
The normal or Gaussian distribution is a powerful analytical tool based in statistical theory that allows us to hypothesize about a population from a relatively small sample size.  While statistics may be misinterpreted or abused, if a large enough set of samples is normally distributed, we can draw important conclusions and make predictions on the larger population.  You may recognize the following plot:

![Gaussian]({{ "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Empirical_Rule.PNG" | absolute_url }})

In a normal distribution...
* half of the population will fall above the mean value and half of the population will fall below the mean value.  
* approximately 68% of the population will reside within one standard deviation (+/-) of the mean, approximately 95% of the population will reside within two standard deviations (+/-) of the mean, and approximately 99% of the population will reside within three standard deviations (+/-) of the mean.

We often base scientific arguments on the above foundation.  You will commonly hear that scientists are 99% certain or 95% certain of a particular conclusion.  These conclusions are typically built on an analysis of a normal distribution which predicts the likelihood that any sample lies within one of the "confidence intervals" defined by each of the different standard deviation factors.

Statistical analysis is often used to gauge the student performance.  The idea of a grading scale is generally based around the normal distribution.  You may wonder where you stand for a particular grade, and at the collegiate level, it can be difficult to determine whether a grade is good or bad.  While instructors and students may wish that a grade is unambiguous, it may be difficult to determine whether an exam is properly calibrated to a particular class before that exam is administered.

For example, you might score a 60 on an exam and you believe that this is a failing grade; however, when you get your final score, it appears that the instructor has "curved" the grade.  In many cases, the instructor does not curve (arbitrarily inflate) so much as normalize the grades to a fair grading scale to account for any instructional mistakes or errors with the exam itself.  

Given the above insight, a normal distribution of grades, the mean, and the standard deviation, you can approximate where your grade may fall relative to the other students without waiting or hoping for a "curve".

## Grade Book

For this assignment, you will load a file containing a set of grades representing the exam performance for a class and you will perform an analysis to try to identify how students are performing on the exams.

We will analyze several sets of grades from a hypothetical class.  Each of the exams produced normally distributed grades so we can analyze the grades using our knowledge of the gaussian.  We would like to normalize the grades based on the relative performance of the students so we need to categorize how students based on the grades they received rather than using an arbitrary grading scale.  While we might think of this as classifying it on a letter grade scale, let's approach this from a slightly different perspective.  

We will apply the following standard to grades: extremely below average, significantly below average, below average, above average, significantly above average, extremely above average.  This standard represents grades smaller than two standard deviations below the mean, grades between two and one standard deviations below the mean, grades between one standard deviation below the mean and the mean, grades between the mean and one standard deviation above the mean, grades between one and two standard deviations above the mean, and grades larger than two standard deviations above the mean.  

If the grades for a given exam with a sample size of 50 are normally distributed, statistically we expect to find one or two students in either of the extreme performance categories, we expect to find about a third of the class in either of the significant categories, and we expect to find about two thirds of the class in the two categories adjacent to the mean.       

Create a file named ```homework09.py```.

Define a function named ```categorizegrades``` to count all students who fall into the standard categories defined above.  Each category is defined by the confidence intervals discussed in the preceding section with respect to the standard deviation and the distance from the mean.  ```categorizegrades``` should have the following definition:

```Python
def categorizegrades(column):
```

```column``` represents a ```numpy``` column (or any slice of a ```numpy.ndarray```) on which to categorize.  ```categorizegrades``` will return a list of lists.  The first list in the list should contain six values where each value represents the count of grades that fall into the associated confidence interval.  The second list in the list should contain the grade value where each confidence interval transitions to the next confidence interval:

The list containing the count should be arranged as:
```
[extremely below average, significantly below average, below average, above average, significantly above average, extremely above average]
```
Assume that a grade that is equal to a confidence interval belongs to the higher group.

The list containing the confidence intervals should contain five values and be arranged as:
```
[mu - 2 * sigma, mu - sigma, mu, mu + sigma, mu + 2 * sigma]
```
```mu``` represents the mean and ```sigma``` represents the standard deviation.

To test your function, you will need to load the file ```grades.txt``` that should be downloaded from [this link]({{ "/gwu/sp19/cs1012/assets/homework09/grades.txt" | absolute_url }}) and placed into the same folder as your script.  This file has four columns and fifty rows (records) where the columns represent the following information:
```
<student id> <grade exam 1> <grade exam 2> <grade exam 3>
```

After loading the file, use ```categorizegrades``` to find out how many students are in each group for each exam.  Print the categorizations for each exam.  Your output should look something like the following:

```
exam 1 : [1, 6, 17, 18, 7, 1], [50.62, 60.87, 71.12, 81.37, 91.62]
exam 2 : [1, 7, 17, 17, 7, 1], [62.35, 70.33, 78.3, 86.27, 94.25]
exam 3 : [1, 6, 16, 20, 6, 1], [73.29, 78.62, 83.96, 89.3, 94.63]
```

The first list following the colon is the count of grades and the second list is the list of confidence intervals.  Your program should produce output with the same values as shown.

> Your confidence interval list will probably contain floating point values and have many more digits than what is shown in the example above.  I used a rounding technique to make the numbers more readable; however, you do not need to worry about matching the format I have used.  As long as the values approximate those shown above to two decimal points, you have a correct answer.

### Submission

Create a zip file containing ```homework09.py``` and submit the zip file before class Wednesday April 17, 2019.
