## Homework 5

### Due Date
**This homework is due March 06, 2019 before class.**

## Introduction
The homework will be divided into two parts.  The first part involves more exercise forming boolean expressions while the second involves writing a program using conditionals.

You **MUST** include comments in your code.  If your code contains no comments, it is incomplete and will not receive credit.  Comments are as important to your code as the code itself.

### Homework 4 - Conditionals

### Part 1
Create a file named ```homework05_pt1.txt```.

This exercise is NOT a programming exercise but is instead a chance to practice using creating boolean expressions.  Write boolean expressions using Python syntax that meet the criteria described in the questions below into the file specified.  You are encouraged to use truth tables to determine the correct operators.

1. Write a boolean expression that evaluates to ```True``` if *all* of the following conditions are ```True``` and otherwise evaluates to ```False```.
  1. ```x``` is negative, ```y``` is between ```1``` and ```10``` exclusively.
  2. ```z``` is positive or negative.
  3. ```a``` is non-zero, ```b``` is evenly divisible.
2. Write a boolean expression that evaluates to ```True``` if *any* of the following conditions are ```True``` and otherwise evaluates to ```False```.
  1. ```b``` is one of the following values ```1```, ```2```, and ```3```.
  2. ```c``` is zero, ```d``` is not between ```4``` and ```6``` inclusively.
  2. ```e``` is non-negative, ```f``` is positive.
3. Write a boolean expression that evaluates to ```False``` if *all* the following conditions are ```True``` and otherwise evaluate to ```True```:
  1. ```g``` is True.
  2. ```h``` is False, ```i``` is non-positive.
  2. ```j``` is non-zero, ```k``` is zero.
4. Write a boolean expression that evaluates to ```False``` if *any* the following conditions are ```True``` and otherwise evaluate to ```True```:
1. ```m``` is larger than ```10``` but less than ```20```.
2. ```n``` is True, ```p``` is odd.
2. ```q``` is zero, ```r``` is non-negative.

Submit ```exercise1.txt```

### Part 2 - Simple Calendar
Create a file named ```homework05_pt2.py```.

Given these facts:
* January, March, May, July, August, October, and December have 31 days
* April, June, September, November have 30 days
* February has 28 days in a non-leap year and 29 days in a leap year

Compute the number of days into the year that a given input date represents.

To simplify the program, we will take input numerically and individually.  For example, the set of inputs that your program must take for calculating a date will look something like this:

```
Enter a year: 2019
Enter a month: 2
Enter a day: 27
```

Your program will compute the number of days into the year that the date specified falls on.  So for the above example, the program should produce the following output:
```
2019-2-27 is day 58 of 2019
```
Your program should account for leap years according to the rules specified in ![Exercise 2]({{ "/gwu/sp19/cs1012/2019/02/27/exercises.html" | absolute_url }})

> We will assume that a user inputs a legitimate date.  This is a rather dangerous assumption; however, we would like this exercise to be a little simplified, so it is an acceptable assumption in an academic scenario.

In addition to the above basic behavior, you will also include the feature to have the program ask the user whether they would like perform the same computation on another date.  If the user chooses the option to compute another date, the program repeats.  The program will continue operating in this way until the user chooses not to compute another date.

For example, after taking the initial input, computing an answer, and printing the output, your program should prompt the user with the following prompt:
```
Would you like to compute another date (y/n)?
```
If the user input for the above prompt is ```y``` the program should repeat itself.  If the user input for the above prompt is ```n``` the program should end.  If any other input is provided, the program should repeat the prompt.

You must test your program to verify that it works and you should particularly test the cases that involve leap years and days after February.  At the minimum, your program should match the following behavior (Note that this is one single execution of the program):
```
Enter a year: 2019
Enter a month: 3
Enter a day: 1
2019-3-1 is day 60 of 2019
Would you like to compute another date (y/n)? y

Enter a year: 2020
Enter a month: 3
Enter a day: 1
2020-3-1 is day 61 of 2020
Would you like to compute another date (y/n)? y

Enter a year: 2019
Enter a month: 12
Enter a day: 31
2019-12-31 is day 365 of 2019

Enter a year: 2020
Enter a month: 12
Enter a day: 31
2020-12-31 is day 366 of 2020
Would you like to compute another date (y/n)?
Would you like to compute another date (y/n)? abc
Would you like to compute another date (y/n)? n
```
