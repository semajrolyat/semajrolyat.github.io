Welcome to Introduction to Programming in Python

This is a placeholder until historical course materials are brought into this repository.

I developed and taught the small inaugural section of the course, worked with senior faculty to develop a stable scalable curriculum for the course, and grew the course to the 200 seat norm offered at the time I was no longer responsible to teach the course. 

I taught the course at GWU during the following terms with the associated cap size listed in parentheses:
<ul>
<li>Fall 2018 (50) <em>Adjunct</em></li>
<li>Spring 2019 (50) <em>Adjunct</em></li>
<li>Fall 2019 (100)</li>
<li>Spring 2020 (200)</li>
<li>Fall 2020 (200)</li>
<li>Spring 2021 (200)</li>
<li>Fall 2021 (200)</li>
<li>Spring 2022 (200)</li>
<li>Fall 2022 (200)</li>
</ul>
